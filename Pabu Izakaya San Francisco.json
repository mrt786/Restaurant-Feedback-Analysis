I asked for a coaster & he didn't give me one, a neighboring customer did.   So I didn't start with a good impression.  Our table server was excellent & the food was amazing.   I do think that the server may have been better about helping us judge how much food to order.  We did over order but managed to eat most of it!",

The sushi and rolls are top notch. It reminds me of one of my favorite San Francisco restaurants Albert Tordjman's The Flying Saucer which sadly closed in 2000 and I have found this wonderful SFO reincarnation. Highly recommended if you visit San Francisco and looking for a unique and fine dining experience,",

I was a bit cold at first, but asked if we could close the door and they had no problems obliging.The food was very tasty and I thought the lunch pricing was great for the caliber, (Sushi was a little bit on the pricey side so I didn\u2019t try it. It may have been worth the price, But it was more than I wanted to spend on a business lunch.)\ufffcHowever my review gets docked a little because I was shocked that a cup of green tea in a Japanese restaurant was $10 per person making it $20 for the pot, (when my entire lunch of Black Cod was only $25).   Otherwise it was a great lunch and I would recommend it. \ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc\ufffc",

While I sat the bar waiting for my friend, bartender Matt took great care of me, making sure I had everything I needed. Once my guest and I were seated, we received exceptional service. Knowing that I was not drinking alcohol, Matt even served us a complimentary glass of nonalcoholic wine. Plus, our server Wil treated us to a complimentary sushi roll. Manager Stanley even came by to see how we were doing. And of course, the food was amazing! I hope to be back soon to celebrate my 23rd wedding anniversary because my wife was jealous that I enjoyed Pabu without her!",

His knowledge of the menu helped me decide everything I ordered and did not disappoint. On that note, The Kanpai was very refreshing and had nice acidity. The inari was tasty and I will come back every time to Pabu if I am in SF specifically to have this! I would say it was a touch too spicy for me, but thats a personal thing. Panko-fried shrimp was good too with the miso cream! The whole squid was a lot, but i enjoyed both ways that they prepared the squid. A minor thing, sometimes the tempura came off the squid before I would even bite it. Tokyo fried rice was tasty, but I was hoping the pork belly pieces would be a bit fried more than put into the rice\u2026 another preference thing. The asakusa was really good and I definitely need to try more rolls next time! With that being said, I enjoyed everything and will be back for more!",

Incredibly overpriced for what it was, 7 courses took >2hours to serve, each course was 4 bites at best, so a lot of time was just sitting around while they kept trying to push you to buy more drinks. When the dishes did come out, the plating was all over the place - it was obvious they weren't prepared for V-Day, despite the it being reservation only and the whole place being filled up. Come here if you have a corporate account, but not on your own dime.",

Pabu has always been one of our favorite restaurants, especially for special occasions, but based on our experience on Saturday night, I'm not sure we will be back anytime soon.  We have always considered their Chicken Karaage the best in the whole of the Bay Area - on Saturday we had to send it back TWICE as it was inedible.  Somehow managed to be both greasy and dry at the same time, don't know if they have changed the recipe or if it was a trainee chef but it was not good.  The edamame had also been overcooked, to the point of some of them being unpleasantly mushy.  The waitress offered us a free dessert to make up for it, but by that point we just wanted to go home!

I pointed out this doesn\u2019t look right & uni is missing. A side of uni arrived later to \u201cfix\u201d 1 of the chef\u2019s oversight. The kama arrived glistening. I opened up the kama & noticed how salty it tasted. I asked my friendly server & Stanley/the MOD if my no salt/oil kama request was relayed to the chef; surprisingly, it was delivered, but not honored. The kama was taken away as we waited 30 minutes as we saw Stanley-Asst mgr-chef-waiter \u201ctalk it out\u201d. We were informed oil coating prevented burning. We wanted to leave, but the \u201ccorrected\u201d kama  finally came out. The bill was charged for regular sashimi, no comps. Stanley apologized, gave me his business card, & asked me to give Pabu chefs another chance. :-/",

We sat at the sushi bar and immediately were asked by our waiter about drinks, which came and were good. Then we were left alone for an hour. The couple next to us had timed it and they were waiting to order for 1 hour 12 minutes. They finally complained and then a bunch of people came out for all of us. The sushi rolls were good. The hot plates, were nothing memorable. The place is priced as upscale, but the service really diminished my opinion of the place. With so many great places in SF, I wouldn\u2019t return.",

To start, our reservation had my partner and I seated at a bar table right next to the main door which was incredibly uncomfortable and not at all romantic. The worst part was that we had to send back our salmon plate because it was completely undercooked. We had to send it back not once, but twice, which resulted in a 20-30 minute wait for each new plate to arrive.Throughout the entire meal, we had people waiting around us and bumping into our table which made it very hard to enjoy our meal. Even the water and drinks took a while to come out, which was frustrating. I expected much better service and quality for the price we paid for the set menu.Overall, the Valentine's set menu at Pabu was a complete disappointment and I would not recommend it. The service was slow and the food was not up to par. It was not a romantic or enjoyable experience and we left feeling unsatisfied and disappointed.",

They did not notify their diners with reservations until the day prior.  I felt that we got tricked into dining with their limited menu.  It\u2019s ridiculous that they took off their robata items and left all the pricey items on their limited menu.  The place was so crowded also compared to their usual occupancy.  The server also took forever to attend to us for anything.  It\u2019s the worst I ever had at Pabu. I normally would pick an occasion in the category up there, but because the crowd they attracted in with their valentine special, it made the place a lot less special.",

The food and drink selection was impeccable as always but our service at the restaurant was what really made this a memorable experience! Aaron took excellent care of my friend and I as it was our first time traveling to San Fransisco. He went above and beyond as our server listing out excellent recommendations for food, drinks, and dessert. He even wrote us a list of places to visit while staying in SF. If you decide to dine at this wonderful establishment hopefully you get seated in Aaron\u2019s section!",

We were celebrating our anniversary and the staff made us feel extra special from the momentt that we arrived, when they gave us a card that the entire staff had signed. The cocktails were unique and amazing - we loved the citrus and the bison cocktails. We originally chose Pabu when looking at the SF Restaurant Week menus, but we ended up ordering off of the normal menu as there were so many different things that we wanted to try! Our favorites were the Monterey Squid Okonomiyaki, Miso-marinated Black Cod, and the Tokyo Fried Chicken Kaarage.Our server was excellent and was very patient with our numerous questions. Our dessert took a little longer, which didn't particularly bother us, but our server very kindly brought us each a glass of amaro while we waited, which felt above and beyond our expectations.Overall we really enjoyed our meal at Pabu and will definitely be returning!",

Been over 18 months since my last visit so my two sushi craving lady companions and I decided to try it out on a a Friday evening.  Sat at our regular booth by the bar and Frederico our server and the floor staff did not disappoint with a spectacular omakase presentation that was timed perfectly for every course.  Super job bro!!  All our old favs like the Happy Spoon with Caviar, Pork Fried Rice, Ken\u2019s Roll, Michael\u2019s Negitoro, and of course the assorted sashimi and nigiri from their veteran itamai chefs were truly delicious in taste and presentation as before.  The packed bar was cranking out my numerous Belvedere tonics with great efficiency and hats off to the back of the house for the superb yakitori platter and hamachi kama.  So as a 62 yr old Nihon born, I say with full confidence that PABU still retains the crown as the BEST Japanese/Izakaya/Sushi in SF!! And don\u2019t forget to cash out some Bitcoin!!",

          "Review": "Treating my little sister (a pastry chef) to come to this place for her very first time in Pabu (a different Michael Mina experience). For 2 of us, we ordered 6 cocktails, 2x Pabu feast, 2xHokkaido Uni, 2x Shima-Aji, 2x Sakura salmon, Spider Roll, Flatiron Waygu beef skewers, 3x beef tongue, 2 happy spoons, Chu toro nigiri.My reservation is at 5:30pm and we were done by 7:25pm ..asked our dessert to be up and the bill too... I understand when I asked my dessert is the most busy time for dinner (Friday night) the server gave me the bill super quick and I quickly provided my credit card too... but waiting for the dessert after I requested for 30 minutes is a bit too much and we have plan at 8pm. Since my little sister is a pastry chef, I really want her to try the dessert from Pabu. But when the dessert arrived at 8pm, the busser learned we have been waiting for such a long time, he apologized. Then the server suddenly came to check? (probably she saw the dessert has been serve) and she apologize while we are rushing to eat the dessert in 2 minutes and tried to run out the door.While we tried to leave, the manager heard? and wanted us to wait for him another 2 minutes, so he can compensate us? (But in my mind.. you want me to wait again? I am in a rush + I already down the dessert in 2 minutes.. I really need to go and you still ask me to wait?)So I told them we have to go.Pabu was one of my favorite places to go because they have great cocktails, nigiri. We usually order once a week for togo or at least dine in for a Friday night once a month with my coworkers since COVID (it is so close by my work place). But this is a very disappointing experience for me to bring my little sister to dine in here (when I told her how great this place was).",

My partner and I also ordered some Japanese beer on tap (between ~$12-$14 for a standard pour), of which I recommend the witbier - it has a lovely jasmine tea taste to it. We enjoyed every course in our meal, but the ones that truly stuck out were the miso cod and the chocolate dessert. I recommend having a glass of port with the latter, as it brought out the tasting notes of the choco and sesame! Due to both COVID and grabbing dinner on a rather calm Halloween, the service was spot on and attentive. We dined inside and it almost felt like a private dining experience. As others note, this place just comes with quite a price tag on it that I am not sure I can afford again (with the $88 pp menu we still ended up paying about $350 for the two of us! How?!?!).

Over nearly 2 hours, we were only able to order one round of drinks because that\u2019s how many times we saw our waiter (once outside ordering food) and we had to get other waiters\u2019 attention to get the check or get plates cleared etc. The food was delicious and the ambiance is amazing, I just felt a little bit ignored while watching other tables get incredible service (one table, the owner seemed to keep visiting with different bottles of sake) which left us wondering \u201cwhy not us?\u201d  I wanted to write it off as they were understaffed or very busy etc but other tables were getting excellent service all around us and we couldn\u2019t even get a second round of drinks. We were so put off that we skipped dessert and everything and paid the bill and left. What started out seeming like it was going to be a fantastic experience left me very disappointed. I\u2019ll definitely give Pabu another chance as the food and drinks were incredible but this was a really awful experience.",

          "Review": "Pabu tried its best, but did not deliver. We came here during COVID for outdoor dining, and both got the restaurant week menu. Service was good. Probably the best part of the meal. The host was very kind, and very upbeat. Our server was a little afraid, but in general attentive and wonderful. The remaining staff was courteous and prompt. Cold water glasses were always filled up, but my hot water was never reupped. Also our dessert took about 20-30 mins after we finished our mains to arrive. This wasn't Pabu's fault, but the sewage truck was on the street right outside draining the sewage the entire time we were having dinner. The smell was AWFUL. And did nothing to contribute to our meal. Food was quite bad to be honest. The app was a snow crab type salad. It was good, well presented, and a good balance of flavors. The mains were both REALLY bad. The Cod was overseasoned, and tasted a little off. Nothing like spoiled, but tasted the way a random clang of keys sounds. The steak was literally raw in the middle and way over cooked on the side. Almost as if someone has put a frozen steak on a pan and tried to cook it. No only that it was pre-sliced (too thickly) and cold when we received it at our table. No bueno. The sushi was actually good, fresh fish but the nigiri wasn't actually shaped that well, and the rice fell apart when I tried to eat. And the desserts were good, but nothing special. Overall, I tried to like Pabu, but god it was so bad. I likely won't ever come back here.",

The sake sommelier was very friendly and this was a nice touch, but since the sushis come and go quick, the sake pairing felt pretty rushing and we caught ourselves many times having to almost chug the glasses so we could keep it up. Because of that, it was hard to remember which sake paired with what and, in the end, we were just drinking the first glass that was in front of us. The Itamae who was serving us also promised a revisit on one of the sushis we most liked, but never server it and started cleaning his counter... I'm totally fine to pay more for good food, but other starred restaurants in SF, including Michelin stars, can offer a way more complex meal + exquisite wine pairings for much less than that.",

Overall, the food was solid but I'd have to say my overall experience was seriously dampened by the fact that after having reminded the hostess and server separately that it was my dad's 80th birthday dinner celebration, they didn't once acknowledge or even bring out a candle to blow out.

I explained the situation to our server Cecilia and everything that followed was fantastic. She helped me craft a semi-fixed menu incorporating house favorites and  a variety of choices  to ensure everyone could find something familiar and new to try. The food delivery was placed well to keep tings moving while giving us time to adjust as needed based on the group enjoyment. Individual drink orders nicely rounded out the options and the service was attentive and professional.  The entire staff that interacted with our table were fantastic. We had a wonderful experience and the out of town business partners left town with a wonderful memory of their trip.  I cannot compliment and thank Cecilia enough for making our evening such an enjoyable success!",

I realize this is a Michael Mina restaurant in SF, so prices are probably expected to be high; however, if I'm being completely upfront I'm always a bit disappointed at the cost for a couple rolls and a bowl of edamame.  Frankly the rolls are small, nothing spectacular.  I go here more for business lunch convenience.  There are some other really great things on the menu, but it is sushi and when spending the extra money on a great restaurant, I want to walk out feeling wow'd.",

Yet unless you chose the most expensive items, it was cheaper to order a la carte.  When we pointed out to the waiter that the items we wanted to order would be $7 less if ordered separately, he seemed completely befuddled.  We instead ordered the Nigiri which was advertised as $30 including a dragon roll. When we inquired as to whether we could order any of the rolls with that, we were told \u201cyes.\u201d  But when the bill came we were charged $40 per person and then told by the waiter that the $30 price was only for one of the dragon rolls.  I understand this, but it would\u2019ve been nice if this had been explained when we were ordering. Moreover, the difference between the price of the dragon roll and the roll I ordered, was only six dollars-\u2013 yet the up charge was $10. Lastly, a cup of green tea was six dollars and no refills were offered.  Bottom line is that, while the food was excellent, we left feeling ripped off and feeling that whoever did the menu pricing was mathematically challenged.",

The restaurant serves sashimi, sushi and various tapas style dishes. The seafood and tapas style dishes are fresh and delicious served by a courteous wait staff. The restaurant has a large lounge area serving all kinds of cocktails and appetizers. PABU has an extensive sake' selection by the bottle but, in my opinion, the prices/mark up is \"extremely high\"! My recommendation is to order the jumai daiginjo, Kurozaemon PABU Label, by the carafe $48.00. This sake' is light, bright and slightly sweet with a clean finish. Pairs well with sashimi and traditional nigiri sushi. When ordering sake', be sure to ask your server for sake' cups, otherwise you will be drinking sake' out of wine glasses.Since this restaurant is located in the Financial District, after work and dinner periods are packed and rather noisy. PABU is not your traditional Japanese restaurant, but is still a great place to visit and enjoy delicious food and drinks!",

We wanted to go really bad but could never get in. I was in town with two small kids and we ended up scoring a 4 top. They treated us like royalty and my wife and I appreciated it a great deal. We feasted. It's not cheap, but you get what you pay for. Felt good for two days after eating here. Definitely will go back with friends and family. It's a loud, festive place, not a quiet stuffy sushi bar.",

Waitress walks by without even looking at us... So difficult to get her attention. Difficult to even get a check. Food was good but ahi poke was much to hot for my girlfriend to eat.",

In Japan, you'd be crammed in a neighborhood, where one chef behind the counter would cook everything, and another would serve and bus.The food is typical izakaya, with an addition of sushi. This is really in keeping with the original spirit of the izakaya in Japan... except the extravagant space and the price.The prices are eye-watering. It's easily double the other comparable restaurants in restaurant, and at least thrice you'd pay in Japan. However, you are rewarded with the immaculate space, excellent service, and location, location, and location.For purely a culinary experience, I'd venture out to other Japanese restaurants in the area, but there is no substitute for its location, particularly if you work in the financial district, and have a convivial moment with your co-workers, friends and such, this is an excellent choice.Be sure to take out a mortgage, though.",

I thought $10 a bowl for miso soup was excessive and the blue fin tuna was reliably overpriced but when I got charged $30 for the standard cheap hot sake that should have been $8-10 max, it was a slap in the face.

I checked in 5 minutes early and was told that the table wouldn't be ready until closer to my appointment time, as they are running late. I sit and wait. I ask for an update about 10 to 15 minutes after my appointment time. The hostess tells me that she will get back to me after she checks the tables to see which tables are close to leaving. I see her walk around the restaurant but she doesn't get back to me after she walks around the restaurant. 20 to 25 minutes after my scheduled appointment has gone by, so I ask the same hostess again for an update. She tells me that another hostess going to check the tables now. At about 30 minutes after my scheduled reservation, they ask us again whether we would like to be seated at the sushi bar or wait another 20 minutes for a table. If they were upfront about how late they were, we would have went directly to the sushi bar in the first place. We decide to eat at the sushi bar. The hostess seats us but doesn't give us a menu.As you can imagine, the rest of the night went downhill from there. Service was incredibly slow. This was the most incredibly underwhelming Omakase experience that I have ever had in my life. Given how late the restaurant was running, I would never have expected sushi chefs to be just standing around while the sushi chef at the station where we were seated alternated between making our Omakase and the sushi orders from the regular tables. We also ordered additional Uni. We were asked if we wanted the Uni to come out first. We said yes but it didn't come out until after a few courses of the Omakase.I decided to try this place out again but I'm certainly regretting it now. From a food standpoint, the Omakase tasted good; however, the service is horrendous. I've ordered ala cart here in the past and was met with mediocre service as well.",

After being rushed to pay despite being told we weren\u2019t going to we went off to press club for a glass of wine. I puked my guts out shortly after arriving at press club and the only thing I had eaten was the sashimi. Not sure if in their rush to close the kitchen if they just gave me the last bit of fish they had left or what.

Why accept a 1:45 reservation and rush customers to order before they are barely even seated and then of course to get served questionable",

Start with the amazing  Kushi oysters half shell.  The Yakitori is so so, the Foie Gras superb.  The pork fried rice is a good closer at the end but don\u2019t forget the Japanese-themed deserts.

So much so that the manager had to come over to take our order and then managed to confuse and mess up just about every course and element of the meal. It was extremely slow, there was massive miscommunication  amongst the staff and it was clear we were not please with the experience and the manager was so ineffective at his job he wasn\u2019t even able to apologize. We had loved PABU before but will unfortunately never be going again. And I never give reviews online but this was such a poor experience for such a nice restaurant that I felt I had to.

Got part of our order wrong but everything else was right. Had ordered 2 sashimis and one order of nigiri. Came out backwards.. not a huge deal. Manager took care of it - picked my plate up quickly and put my new order in. Was disappointed to find out they tossed nice chu toro and yellow tail. I would have taken it if I had known they would have tossed it but \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. Our waiter never really apologized or acknowledged it. But I guess the manager said sorry... was also a little underwhelmed the nice sashimi was on ice, making it super cold. Maybe I\u2019m being a little boujee with that but typically only see poor quality fish on ice - this was too nice to do that with. Last, after trying to track down our waiter and finally getting him, we had the extra sushi on our bill... and again no apology. I guess if you\u2019re spending that much money for food and service, I\u2019d expect a little nicer service.",

The prix fix must be crazy good.   Note the prices are higher here than other sushi places and the pieces you get are slightly smaller, but you are getting seriously good quality food.  If you want a slightly quieter setting,  ask to sit in the atrium instead of the main room which is pretty energetic.",

Having previously been to Hana in Petaluma, and being beyond amazed with not only the service and quality of product, but also the quaint personalized dining feel of a greatly ambianced atomosphere, I was very disappointed with my experience at PABU. The set up outside and entrance where very beautiful and encouraged excitement, but it quickly passed. I opted for a counter reservation because I was hoping for a more involved Omakase experience, however, this didn\u2019t happen. While the server himself was very nice and offered some recommendations, the sushi chefs seemed to be less than thrilled to be there and didn\u2019t offer any interaction. Heads down and hands busy. The nigiri ordered was delicious, bright and fresh, but the experience itself was lacking and not what I had set out for. The bar was nice and seemed busy, it wasn\u2019t overly loud, seating area itself wasn\u2019t overly crowded. The food was great, but the experience as a whole was fairly mute. We could have been at any random sushi place in the city and had a better time. Came for a birthday celebration and it was a huge let down.",

It was our first time there, so we were expecting to be able to order small plates and sample different menu items as we progressed through our evening but the time between ordering and receiving was just too long so we wrapped up as soon as we could.

Its prices are fairly typical for San Francisco, and if the bill adds up, it was worth every penny. The sushi was good, but what makes PABU outstanding were the small plates. The PABU chef must have a real talent for sauces and flavor combinations. A few days later, I'm still thinking with pleasure about the miso-marinated black cod, not just because of the cod, but because of the extraordinary smoky broth it was in and the flavor that gave the clams. Ditto the oysters. I love oysters, and I have to say the oysters I had at PABU were better -- creamier, and more flavorful -- than the same oysters I had at Hog Island the day before. I usually prefer oysters plain (no vinaigrettes, no sauces) but these oysters had the smallest amount additional flavor (a tiny bit of daikon, a tiny bit of chili, a tiny bit of ponzu). Something I'd never had before, something small and perfect.       The sake list is incredible, and because they provide short descriptions for each one on the menu (\"pear, apples, lilac\" or \"cedar, hay, cooked cherries\") it's fun to experiment. The only thing the sake list doesn't tell you is whether the sakes are sweeter or drier, so you'll have to ask if you have a preference. But the sommeliers are all friendly and helpful and steered us toward some fantastic sakes, that weren't particularly expensive. (Not cheap, but not more than we'd have spent on a bottle of nice California wine at another restaurant.)    The restaurant is lively and a bit loud, but we had a booth and I was surprised to find that the noise wasn't a problem.",

The total check for 2 people was $300 NOT including service - and we only had one carafe of cheap sake (half bottle) shared in 2. I don\u2019t have issues to invest money in food that deserves it, but definitely there are other Japanese restaurants in SF with better quality of food for at least half the price. Michael Mina adds the marketing cost directly into your pocket. Food was fine, but not worth it to come back.",

I had a wonderful date this week at Pabu SF and was blessed to find Ken-san in the house and serving up his magical culinary alchemy. Words do not do justice to his talents for both imaginative and traditional Japanese food and drink nor to his passion for quality and exceptional hospitality. He spoiled us with special treats including an amazing heirloom tomato salad - his take on a burrata and tomato salad with nori chips and tofu cream instead of cheese - truly exquisite! You really can't go wrong on their menu whether you choose sushi, robatayaki or splurge on the most delicious wagyu I've ever put in my mouth! His culinary offering is paired with equally imaginative and delicious cocktails and an impressive offering of special sakes, wines and spirits. My mouth is still watering as I type this review and remember my divine experience of a few nights ago. We will be back :)",

Everything was very tasty and the sushi chef sauced the sushi. The reason for not having five stars is because of the size of the slices of fish. They\u2019re about one half to maybe two thirds the size of of most other sushi restaurants around the world that are highly rated.  Great service by everyone and nice casual yet refined atmosphere but you can\u2019t slice either of those.",

The service was the best, seated immediately, we received our beverages right away.  Our server helped us with special menu items, as we had a friend with a gluten allergy. He brought over dishes specially prepared for her and made sure the we were very clear on which dishes she could eat.  We enjoyed both cooked and raw fish dishes.  I would highly recommend the cod/mussels and the pork belly skewers (so would my kids). The service level at this restaurant was impeccable...super polite, cordial, friendly, attentive, helpful.   We would definitely go again..and again..and again.",

Still smelled like him when I walked in but I came just to make sure Pabu was still Warriors' Ground.....That was nice of Pabu to show the game projection style on the wall.  Of course Dubs won in OT so I could relax and enjoy the wine and sushi with my favorite ladies.  Pabu is the BEST SF Japanese food, it just ain't cheap by any means.  Three of us cost $850 including tip.......but the Warriors won thank the Buddha......so it was all worth it!",

And the service leaves much to be desired.  A couple of examples:  I ordered a sashimi sampler, which I was informed was chef's choice.  Fine.  But then when the server brought the sampler he just left it on the table, without any explanation as to what the different fish were.  Another server took away my plate without replacing it.  It took almost 10 minutes before another server came by and brought my a new plate.",

Things started off fine and we ordered a bunch of cooked items and nigiri. We received the cooked items only and were told the nigiri would come soon. We added some additional pieces of nigiri to the order and a cocktail. 1 hour later our first batch of nigiri never arrived. Then less than 1/2 of the 2nd nigiri order arrived (still no word on the 1st). Still we were told everything was coming. No apologies, no issue, everything was still coming. After another 30 minutes, I spoke with the manager who was great and tried to take care of us. He got of the 1st order we were missing and poured us some sake, but didn't realize about all of the other things we didn't receive. Then once I told him everything else we were missing, he was going to get us some other items. The manager really did try to go above and beyond, but at that point my group was tired and didn't want to eat there anymore. He ended up giving us a nice discount, which was appreciated. Then our wonderful waiter filled up our glasses again and called my wife darling again. There was really no way to miss it on the second run. While we had been many times in the past and I've always loved their ramen shop, I don't think we'll be back.",

The sushi/sashimi is top notch and the the fish very fresh plus the sushi rice is premium short grain and well seasoned.  The kushi oysters on the half shell were simply priceless!  That said, I do not recommend the yakitori.  It comes from the kitchen and does not have that authentic bincho charcoal grill flavor, texture or smokiness you get in a traditional yakitori joint.  Everything else on the menu is fantastic, my 94 year old Japanese mother loved the deep fried whole karei flat fish, miso soup, and pork fried rice.  Service is always front and center, servers are knowledgeable and professional.  Also the bar is a great place to hang out but no TV's!!!!",

I first thought that he would have given me the last two pieces on a smaller plate, but then realized that he had mistakenly omitted the missing pieces. I reported to the waiter what was missing. The sushi chef overheard and ARGUED that he had made everything! To show his mistake, I repeated the order of a few kinds of sushi. When the second plate of assorted sushi was served, I asked the waiter to explain what fish every piece of sushi was of in front of us, and then pointed out the missing ones from the first plate, which I had exactly told my waiter but the sushi chef eagerly had had to argue with me about.

Service was excellent: very prompt, attentive without hovering. The fish was fresh and tasty but I have two notable concerns. The slices are definitely on the small side and they don\u2019t sauce the nigiri. For the price I think Hatsuhana in Manhattan is superior. Slices of fresh fish of the size I\u2019m accustomed to in most good sushi restaurants around the world. And they sauce the nigiri with the sauces that bring out the flavor. Another comparison are the sushi bars around Tsukiji market. Outstanding omakase with extremely fresh fish properly sauced for less than a third of price of either Pabu or Hatsuhana. Too bad it takes so long to fly to Tokyo.",

Hostess would not hand over any better location, say a more quiet table in the bar, and was not very nice about it.  I ended up eating quite literally at the bar with a good client, sort of embarrassing.  Food was decent, not as good as Ozumo, but good.  Service by the bartender was good.

Several parties showed up after me and were all told the same thing. Every one of those parties were seated before me. One of the sushi chefs gave me a very rude look and curt reply when she brought food to my table, and I mistook her for my server and asked for an additional hand roll. I told the man that took my drink order that I would like sake and water with ice in it. I got a glass of warm water filled to the brim. We never saw the same person twice at our table.

The roll I got was about half the diameter of what I\u2019m used to but was certainly tasty. There was no option for tap water so we spent $16 on water for 2.

But multiple long periods passed without seeing him, and then there's the eggplant.The food was uneven.  Some of the robata items were very good, others were not.

Instead, I spent the dinner glumly staring at the sushi chef while slowly clenching and unclenching my hands in frustration.TLDR: spend your hard-earned money elsewhere.Ordered omakase ($120) plus supplement ($39) for two at the sushi bar. With sake and tip, final bill was $550, and I regret all of it.45+ minutes to first course which was a \"happy spoon\" of briney seafood amalgamated together. 15 minutes to second course, which was an unremarkable carpaccio, and mine arrived messed up by waiter's thumb.What really bothered me was the then 30 additional minutes for a cold chawanmushi. Cold! Why!? Poor flavor and it took 30 minutes for that to arrive. It's now been almost 1.5 hours since I ordered dinner, and even the sushi chef is starting to freak out at the kitchen because she's probably weirded out by me sitting there just staring off, obviously very hungry. I got so hungry I ordered a la carte nigiri in between courses.The nigiri courses after the disaster that come out of the kitchen was pretty good. Supplement bought 1x toro, 1x A5 wagyu, and 1x foie gras. Overall good, but the foie gras had a warmed exterior and ice cold center.Service was horrible. I saw the waiter twice - once when I ordered and once when he dropped off the bill. The waiters at the service station on the end of the sushi bar would gossip loudly. The food runners didn't know what they were delivering and flubbed describing the food.The sushi chefs were busy drinking and partying with the Japanese group at the end of the sushi bar. I have zero problems with this as a general rule, but it contributed to a feeling of being completely ignored and forgotten.Was this an off-night? I doubt it. It's Friday night and I had a 7:45 reservation. If you're not on your game for a Friday night, I don't know when you ever will be.",

We made online reservations a few days in advance, arrived a few minutes early, and were promptly seated, but at a table near the bar area. My general impression was that this was an area covered by a variety of servers instead of just one -we had a number of people checking on us/taking orders/etc. They were all professional and friendly, (no complaints there) but the result was rather unpredictable service. We'd get checked on a couple times back to back, then not at all for a while. Our plan to order some appetizers and sushi, then keep ordering based on how we were feeling, fell apart when it took 35+ minutes for our first sushi roll to arrive. The appetizers were timely though. And when, 30 minutes after we ordered, the server asked us if we wanted anything else to eat, she seemed surprised/nonchalant when we mentioned we were still waiting on our original order. We decided to cut the meal short and move on. At the pace we were at, waiting on a steak to arrive would have taken hours.Not a terrible experience, but not what we'd expect for a restaurant like this one. Will likely skip as an option next time we're deciding where to have a nice dinner.",

She did try to get us out within the hour so we were very grateful.  The food was great, however, we recalled that we had 3 pieces of sea bass and 3 puffed pastry the last time we had this Out to Lunch Menu, so we felt that they scaled down on the food a bit.  Would prefer the same portion from last year more.    The puff pastry is not as good as last year too.  It's a little bit harder than last year.  Last year's pastry tasted like a sugar donut.",

          "Review": "This was honestly one of the most disappointing dining experiences of my life. My date and I arrived promptly on time for our dinner reservation- my BF's birthday. We were sat at a table in the bar section of the restaurant. Our waitress asked us for our drink orders and then disappeared for about 15 minutes. She came back and we ordered an appetizer. Appetizer came out in about 10 minutes. Another 20 minutes pass and our waitress never comes back to our main order. We flag another waitress down and put in an order for a medium-rare steak and two sushi rolls. 45 minutes go by and our meal doesn't arrive. We finally see our first waitress and ask her to please check on our meal- she says that they're holding the sushi rolls until the steak is done. Another 30 minutes go by and we still don't have anything. BF gets up and has to find another waiter to ask them to at least bring out the rolls. Another 10 minutes go by and they finally get the food out. In total we waited over an hour and a half to get our main course. It was overall a very disappointing experience- if the kitchen was busy they could have at least communicated better about what was happening & if it's because we were sat in the bar section, I honestly don't see that as an excuse (especially because I made a reservation and included in the notes section that this was for a birthday dinner). Honestly, such a bummer- especially considering how highly rated this place is. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone after the experience we had here.",

          "Review": "I went to Pabu recently with my two foodie teenage sons and a girlfriend. We had   had the omikase and kanseiki tasting menus. The omikase tasting menu was exceptional and the kanseiki meal was very good, with a notable standout being the oyster tasting spoon which began each meal. The sushi was extremely fresh and flavorful and my sons (who ordered the omikase meal) ate every bit of it. My suggestion for the kanseiki meal would be to do some other interesting courses in place of the tempura and perhaps the beef. The vegetable tempura was good but not a standout and the the beef was ok but also not exceptional.There were some great menu items on the a la carte menu that could have been more interesting choices on this tasting menu. Also, I would prefer black cod or another white fish instead of the overly-rich chilean sea bass for the cooked fish course.  If I had to do it again, I would order the omikase meal or a la carte items. That being said, the desserts that came with the tasting menus were fantastic.",

Perhaps it's because I asked her to recommend a \"mild\" wine instead of \"light\" and her response was to repeat \"mild\" in the form of a question. Or when my girlfriend asked if you serve \"Philadelphia Roll\" and her response was \"we don't serve cream cheese here\". I can think of a thousand ways she could've responded in a more courteous, even playful manner that would have been more appropriate. And finally, when I was selecting sushi rolls I could decide on a second roll and when I asked her to recommend one, she simply stated \"that's up to you\". So instead of trying to upsell me, she turned me off and I ended up with one INCREDIBLE Spicy tuna roll (compliments to the chef for everything we enjoyed). Adding insult to injury, once I decided on a sushi roll, she walked away rolling her eyes and shaking her head in an exasperated manner (almost child-like). Not sure why she treated us this way, when we saw her interacting with other patrons in a much better fashion including asking them if they had any allergies and recommending dishes/beverages/etc.  We must have caught her in a negative moment.We didn't get her name (even though I wanted to) but the the check/table numbers were Check # 1313/Table 92 .Everyone else at PABU (from Valet/Hostess/Bussers/Runners) were absolutely amazing and represented PABU exceptionally. It's unfortunate how this was all overshadowed by the one person who is expected to \"nail it\".I don't expect (nor do we wish) a follow-up. I simply want to let management know that you may need to conduct some retraining.Thank you.",

So many awkward in-betweens waiting for our next order. Service was not only slow but our server could be a bit nicer. I don't think she's aware of her insincere approach. It wasn't even that busy. We had to cancel our final orders after 15 minutes of waiting. FIFTEEN MINUTES for 2 rolls. Our server came back once to check in. When we first sat down, she came back 3x within 10 minutes to check in, when it was obvious we were talking about serious business first. Frustrating visit. For the 4th time. Never again, Pabu.",

We decided to keep our reservation. The place was packed out. Could it be coz it was the first nice day after a few rainy days!? Or maybe they're always this busy. The service was impressive tho. Prompt, attentive, courteous and friendly. Both at the bar and eventually dinner considering it was so busy. 7:30, prime time. The food did not disappoint. Scrumptious, just as I remembered. My only complaint, we got seated at the sushi bar. I consider that type of seating for walk-ins and quik stops?! I had booked over a week ago. But still overall was a good dining experience since we did come for their food and THAT was excellent!!",

Disappointing because their other place Hanna is much better.  Ambience.  Nice, clean dark and moody.  Don't expect to hear someone 3 feet in front of you talking.  Booths are comfy and great menu design.  The place is visually very impressive.Food.  We did not try the omokase or keiseki.  Instead we opted for an assortment from other the menu.  Sushi rolls were very bland. Simple without getting the nuance of simple ingredients right.  Michaels negitori roll was a stand out.  Overall great ingredients of high quality but I felt I've had better for much cheaper which is ultimately what it boils down to when you ask customers to plunk down that sort of cash.",

The food, however was not exceptional and I cannot recommend any dish that I ate except the mocchi dessert and that was excellent.  The squid was overcooked, dry and tough, particularly on the ends (large center rings were not as tough).  The spinach had been sweetened and could have been tasty had it not tasted like a dessert--I was expecting savory and we had not been told that the spinach would be sweetened.  The miso soup had an odd flavor and tasted old and stale.  It was difficult to determine why the miso flavor failed.  Perhaps it was the added mushrooms?  It did not taste like any of the miso soups that I have had in numerous restaurants in Japan nor in San Francisco or other Japanese restaurants, nor was it as good as my miso soup made at home.  Clearly a disappointment.  We had chosen PABU because it was on the list of 100 best restaurants in San Francisco and we often choose from that list.  My husband said that his sushi was good and that the fish used in his sushi was tender and fresh.  I might try it again for happy hour and try different dishes as the ambiance and personnel were excellent.",

Sunday's are definitely the day to go ---the happy hour pricing lets you try a wide variety of items.  We recommend going with at least three or four people to try some sakis and a wide variety of items.

The sashimi was fine, but any dish with rice, like nigiri sushi, maki rolls, hand rolls, etc. were pretty bad.  The rice was totally overcooked,  like mush in the mouth, not how sushi rice should taste.So we switched to the skewers and on the recommendation of the server had the chicken meatballs.   We expected a well seasoned lean meat  and what we got was like they put a whole chicken into a blender, skin, fat and all, then added a little salt.  No tasty seasoning and a poor taste and texture overall.Great setting, but  we were really disappointed by the food.",

We were there ten minutes early for our reservation at the sushi bar. The bar was half full, and the tables mostly full, however the restaurant was fully staffed. This shouldn't have happened.  The next issue was one of the items on the set menu, the A5 beef. A5 beef is a destination for a special type of beef, the highest quality.  This was not A5. It was under cooked and chewy, not the near melt-in-your-mouth tender and fatty that is A5. This was not even USDA Prime.Now, the beef was served out of sequence according to the menu, and the waiter said it was because the kitchen was swamped, but this was near to 11:15 pm and we were of the last few dining, so clearly that wasn't so. Perhaps they ran out of the A5. Not Michael Mina quality. Otherwise, all the other items on the special menu were great, especially the chicken & onion, chicken meatball, and pork belly. The pork belly, butabara was melt-in-your-mouth, what the A5 should have been. And they have a new cocktail selection, which we had 8. I would eagerly order any of them again.  The whiskey and rye cocktails were especially good, as either whiskey or rye can overwhelm a cocktail with their strength.",

Between the challenge of seating and serving a larger party, and the distractions of unfinished business around the table, the food comes and goes and all of that great work barely makes an impression.That was not the case at PABU.  To begin with, you could tell that the experienced service staff was right at home with larger business parties.  Our server was present and attentive without being intrusive.  He took charge with a light touch in guiding the choice of drink and food, and kept the service moving at a comfortable pace that felt relaxed but left no one drumming his or her fingers on the table waiting.The star of the night, though, was the food.  We ordered a wide variety of sushi and maki,  and to the last piece there was not a weak link in the entire selection.  My normally jaded, well-traveled dining companions took time to comment on the individual items, discuss the preparation, and ooh and aah over the flavor.Several of us shared an Uber back to our hotel afterwards, and everyone of us was already talking about finding an opportunity to return.  Consider this my highest level endorsement with the caveat that we dropped some serious coin that night.  But if you're in the mood for a great meal, you can't do better than what we had last Thursday.",

The server suggested 3-5 dishes per person, which is about right, but wasn't really satisfying - maybe because I didn't enjoy what I had enough. We had the tofu, (my favorite dish of the night), and the robata tasting (everything was cold, tough and unseasoned except the chicken meatballs and skirt steak), and the dueling tempura (it was okay - batter was hard, but not crispy), and the chawanmushi (I love chawanmushi, so this was the biggest disappointment - it was over salted and unpleasantly fishy and the scallop was super-tough - for $15 for a tiny portion, this is criminal). Also, izakaya is for sharing, but the portions aren't really big enough to share.  We also had kampachi nigiri, which was very nice.

Sushi roll highlights were ken's roll, western tempura roll, and the Tokyo roll. A little pricy for relatively simple rolls, but the quality of fish surpassed the need for elaborate sauces/ toppings. Would highly recommend for a date or celebration. Prepare to spend a fair amount because it is worth it to try a variety of yummy flavors. Drinks were pricy but all unique and tasty.",

The dressing was light and the salad refreshing. Ahi Tuna Poke in tobiko, negi, crisp wonton was a good combination. Second course, I chose Miso Black Cod with squash, snap peas, in clam broth served with rice...favorite dish of the night. Cod was smooth with good texture and melts in your mouth...simply delicious. My husband chose the Bara Chirashi, which consists of assorted fish, seafood, sashimi and salmon eggs. Fish was cut into cubes and served over rice with a stick of tomago sushi on top. The seafood was well-seasoned and tasty. Final course was dessert. I had the Japanese Doughnut Puff stuffed with yuzu curd, strawberry, whipped cream and lemon meringue. It was light and delectable and not very sweet. My husband's Sake Kasu Pudding included bruleed stone fruit, marcona almonds, shortbread, was also light but somewhat tasteless. All the courses were well prepared and presented exquisitely. Waitress was friendly and helpful. Service was attentive. Great ambience and pleasant surroundings. Will return to try dinner some day.",

We arrived early and the hostess was so sweet and sat us early in the dining room where a card was waiting for my husband signed by the staff, so thoughtful! The whole meal was amazing, we ordered a lot of different things and they were all so good! I think he loved the meat skewers the most and I loved the miso soup, tempura, and sushi rolls. The cocktails were great as well. Ambiance was perfect (although music could've been better). We can't wait to go back!",

It also included a custard, Shabu Shabu, soup, and a delicious oyster to start with called \"Happy Spoon\". It was amazing. Being from Michigan it was a great experience for us.

We had hoped to sit at the sushi bar, and they did everything they could to accommodate us, but I wish they had encouraged us to sit in a booth. Sushi bar is only really good for 2 people. Also, it is not an intimate setting in general. Seems to be geared towards big groups in the back for special occasions. We were shocked by the state of the bathrooms. The food was good, my favorites were the small plates, foie gras, monterey squid salad, egg custard dish was good too. The sushi was okay, but we didn't try a roll, although they looked very good. The sake was very good and so was the charity cocktail. It was very loud, so if you're going for romantic and intimate, this may not be the best choice.",

The servers are sweet and attentive yet they also know  how to keep their distance. We were celebrating our 5 year wedding anniversary and received a cute card signed by all the servers after being seated. You can't go wrong with anything on their menu; we weren't sure if we wanted to choose the Omakase option or order off the menu but there was so much to try so we figured we'd order what looked good. The A5 wagu was amazing! They also have amazing choices for their nigiri options and some of the freshest Uni i've had.",

When we arrived, the hostess sat the four of us in the bar area at a high bar booth.  We sat there (it's very dark) for several minutes before anyone greeted us, took a drink order or brought us water.  Because we couldn't see the menu, eventually someone took pity on us and decided to bring us over magnifying glasses with lights so that we could read.    When we finally ordered (from the manager who walked by), we found the food to be just okay and definitely not worth the prices.  The seating was a bummer because the four of us couldn't all talk to each other.  More of a disappointment was the service. Lack of attention to detail (had to repeatedly ask for soy sauce for our sushi) and kind of a \"could care less\" attitude.",

Our favorite dish was the Maitake Mushroom Tempura with dashi-soy dipping sauce, very light with incredible flavor.  These were all small plates but great for sharing.

For a restaurant that prides itself on service, it was difficult to get drinks. When we did, the cocktails came with flat water (not soda water as described), the wine was never refilled and when the bottle was empty, we were never provided with the wine list, and additional cocktails were not offered. The food was certainly the star. Would have been nice if the service could have matched for almost $115 per person (not the tasting menu).",

          "Review": "Want to try some top rated Japanese contemporary food in the heart of the San Francisco's Financial District? Then grab your wallet, hang on and go to Pabu. This restaurant offers some of the chic-iest Japanese food around. A little contemporary, a little new wave & a little pricey is the order of the day if choosing to eat at this high rent local. Pabu features \u201cizakaya\u201d style dining: it\u2019s like fancy bar type food, perfect for sharing & eating family style - the bar features prominently in the scheme of things. The ambiance can be described as lively & 5 bell noisy. If noise is not part of the plan, an atrium off the main dining room is better suited to those accustomed to a more subdued environment.One stand out is the service. When management realized the valet had not arrived for early diners, they called one from one of their sister restaurants. When the main dining room was a bit to noisy, accommodations were made to eat in the atrium. Special food requests were handled with aplomb.The food, some of it flown in from Japan, is really good, although one might want to consider whether the cost benefit will be worth it! They also take advantage of domestic delicacies, such as the shigoku oysters, a Pacific Northwest small, dense oyster that came with a little wonderful sauce that delighted the taste buds. The sesame spinach was cooked just right & the miso cod did not disappoint. \u201cShoga\u201d, or ginger that accompanies sushi, had a delicious mild touch to it. The meal was not accompanied by rice, but offered as a side dish-beware, 1 bowl could feed a family of 4. Dessert was mostly an American affair with subtle Japanese touches-the expresso pudding included sponge cake shavings & the Okinawa doughnuts (table favorite) featured Okinawa sugar.At the end, you may need smelling salts for the bill, but an enjoyable time will be had by all. The first rate service, the good food and great company makes a special outing for any occasion.",

The high quality of the menu is what one has come to expect from Ken Tominaga (owner of Hana in Rohnert Park), but in a much more stylized setting.  Sushi is the centerpiece, although they have a varied menu befitting an izakaya. Prices are definitely eye opening; I'm sure rent isn't cheap. A very aesthetically pleasing space. Booths are well designed but general seating table spacing seems a bit tight.  Noise level seemed reasonable. Put yourself in Stuart's (master sake sommelier) hands and you can't go wrong.

Service was terrible.  Entres came almost an hour after apps.  Had to get up to chase down server to replenish drinks.  Servers were not at all apologetic.  Seemed like they are accustomed to long delays and being chased down by patrons begging for service.One thing that has not changed since the last time I was there is their prices.  It's inexcusable IMO that they are charging top tier prices and delivering such a disappointing experience.",

I mentioned Shane that my friends are coming in a few min, we'll have a drink and move to our table for dinner in 15min max. This was not OK with him. Shane in very agitated manner started making a scene and made me move to the corner of the bar by the exit door. IMHO, this manner to treat guests (that make your living) is unacceptable. No more Pabu for me or any of my friends.Alanp.s. had few bites and drinks at the restaurant - good food, good wine. but the experience was ruined for me by Shane",

This made our dinner MUCH more enjoyable, as we could actually hear each other and have some elbow room, and the staff was SUPER nice about it.We got attentive and extremely gracious service from our waitress Cecilia--absolutely no complaints there!Cocktails were excellent, as they were on our prior visit.Grilled octo appetizer was amazing as it was last time--wish they had this as a large plate, as I would totally eat THIS for dinner!Sushi (yellowfin, hamachi, ocean trout) was fresh with a substantial kick of wasabi in the sushi rice underneath. Gyoza was OK. Skirt steak skewers were absolutely delicious, though the hubby says Pabu's skewers are always a bit too salty.Dessert was an amazing chocolate pudding-type desert that didn't sound that great, but our waitress sold us on it and wow, it really was great!  LOVED the salt from the miso wafer to balance the dish, also loved the crunch of the cocoa nibs.  This was a very well balanced dish, not too sweet.They also brought us a complimentary desert, a green tea cake with yuzu ice cream.  This was very kind!  The cake was not for us, seemed not super-fresh and the white frosting was too sweet, but the yuzu ice cream was delicious.A last note, at the table we received a \"happy anniversary\" card signed by the staff!  Wonderful touch.We'll be back!",

The service once we sat down was great as well.The reason why I'm not giving 5 stars - and was a little tempted to give 3 stars - is because our reservation apparently didn't mean much to them (or they have very poor scheduling).  I made a reservation for two at 7:45pm, but we weren't seating until 8:15pm despite my inquiries.  Apparently there were several groups ahead of us - unclear whether or not they had a reservation and were waiting as well.This has NEVER happened to me at any restaurant, much less one that was as highly rated as this.

To top it off our server was extremely rude! We spent $200 for mediocre sushi and service.... Not worth it. The second bad time was last Thursday. I went in for brunch with some girls and requested a booth a week ahead. Although there were many booths open in the sunny front area our host tried to sit us in the darkest last booth possible. With some hesitation we got to sit in a better booth. The host was very confused and clueless. To top it off we were ignored by our waitress for so long that we flagged a bartender to take our order. The food was decent  but the service once again was bad. I have been embarrassed twice now by bringing guests to this restaurant and receiving bad service and bad food.

The fish selections were great, but nothing was outstanding and the meal took forever. Our meal lasted for 3 hours, with at least a 35 min downtime in between the end of the sushi course waiting on shabu. It's a great restaurant for special occasions, but the nigiri pieces are considerably smaller than most sushi restaurants in SF, so you leave hungry. Add that to a horribly slow meal and high prices, and I wouldn't go again.",

The first disappointment came two weeks ago we got served fish that looked so old the skin attached to the fish was curled up and dry. I braved taking a bite which was not a good idea. To top it off our server was extremely rude! We spent $200 for mediocre sushi and service.... Not worth it. The second bad time was last Thursday. I went in for brunch with some girls and requested a booth a week ahead. Although there were many booths open in the sunny front area our host tried to sit us in the darkest last booth possible. With some hesitation we got to sit in a better booth. The host was very confused and clueless. To top it off we were ignored by our waitress for so long that we flagged a bartender to take our order. The food was decent  but the service once again was bad. I have been embarrassed twice now by bringing guests to this restaurant and receiving bad service and bad food. PABU is very expensive and does not live up to the Michael Mina name. If you're looking to sushi I would recommend going elsewhere.",

Chris took great care of us and made sure each step of our dinner felt well paced and relaxing. Stewart the Sake Sommelier made the night for us. Warm personable and an encyclopedia of knowledge about Sake. He touched our table a number of times but did not dominate our time. Perfect balance in all ways possible for a dining experience.  Hence my 6 stars. Thank you Team Pabu for making our date night simply perfect!  Bravo!",

Skip the shabu-shabu course at the end and substitute some addition sushi. (Pabu understands sushi but hasn't a clue about shabu-shabu.) We have been at least a dozen times now and still enjoy the subtle sushi preparations and fantastic sake pairings. The thoughtful delicate preparations will train your palate to discern fine differences in fish and sakes. Very high quality and expensive but worth it.Unfortunately, the original desert chef has left and the new chef is quite heavy-handed and not up to the previous standards. The original deserts were light, transparent, Japanese-style creations and the perfect ending for the subtle tastes which you experience during the tasting. The new chef's creations are heavy and opaque and leave you feeling tired rather than uplifted. Our recommendation is to skip desert altogether and ask for a few additional Japanese gummy bears when you leave the restaurant.",

When we arrived, we were told that the current customers were paying so that it would be only a few minutes to be seated. Well, we ended up waiting for 30 minutes to get a seat. They kept telling us that the seat was 'almost' ready during that time. It was very frustrating experience. When we seated. we ordered a soft shell crab okonomiyaki offered as their one year anniversary special menu. The waitress came back much later telling us that the dish was just sold out. We had to change our order to ordinary, non special oknomiyaki. We were very upset because if we were seated right away, we would have probably gotten it. The food came really late. We had to wait another thirty minutes to get the first dish. So, we had to wait an hour to eat something.  The food overall was mediocre. Especially, the okonomiyaki we had to order was terrible. Pabu wings were acceptable, but nothing special. I had better sushi in other restaurants. The only thing I liked was the draft beer I ordered. Maybe they were too busy because of their one year anniversary. But as a frequent customer, I was deeply disappointed at the level of service I received.",

After finishing the sashimi/nigiri dishes, we waited over 30 minutes for the last course, the wagyu beef. We had to flag several people down and ask both Ben and our server a few times why the wait. It took forever to get this last dish. When we finally did, neither of us were hungry. We then had the dessert course coming, which took another 20 minutes. The food was good but for the price, I expected a better execution throughout the course of the meal.",

Their cocktails and drinks section is quite unique witha lot of variety in terms of old fashioned as well as exotic drinks. Of special mention is the outstanding selection of Japanese  whiskies, the best that I have seen anywhere. Beware though that If you go hungry then expect to rack up a large tab as the food is delicious but comes in small portions. The place is quite big and energetic so will make for a very memorable evening. Service and food quality was outstanding.",

The food was just \"okay\" without any novelty or nuance, and much could have used a bit more spice. One favorite was the chicken meatballs, very good and the accompanying quail egg sauce wonderful. The service was so lackluster that we never got a chance to look at the dessert menu. This is obviously a watering hole for the FiDi workers in the area and the bar is crowded and noisy after the workday is through (it opens at 3 p.m. during the week).

To start out the meal, our server recommended a chef's choice sushi platter and it was delicious. Each sushi selection was a perfect start to our lunch. Not only was it fresh, but it was deliciously prepared and presented to us. Our team picked through various surf and turf items on the menu.

I finally had the chance last night and I was underwhelmed.The space is great, and it's a lovely menu for both food and beverages. Overall, I felt the prices were high and the portions were small. The service was fast to begin with, and then extremely slow for the last item we ordered as the restaurant became busier.We started with the Yuku Kanpachi. It was delicious but they were teeny tiny bite size pieces (5 in total).Next up was the Robatayki. We tried the trumpet mushrooms. They had a decent flavor, but yet again, the pieces on the skewer were tiny in size. We tried the grilled squid based on reviews and the waiter's recommendation. It was our least favorite dish. They had an odd flavor and were served with a mayonnaise dipping sauce. No thanks.The standout dish Ken's roll, and I'm not a tempura fan, but the tempura was light and the flavor was delicious, so much so that we ordered a second roll.Lastly, we had the Miso black cod based on reviews and the waiter's recommendation. I really enjoyed this dish. It has a sweet almost caramel flavor to it. My friend did not like it.I had a glass of the Pinot Noir and my friend had a glass of cold sake. While both were nice, they were pricey at $17/glass.I was glad to have experienced the cuisine and restaurant, but I would not rush back.",

Unfortunately the rear pane of the fish case was frosted with condensation, so it was rarely possible to watch the actual preparation, which is part of the pleasure of sitting at a sushi bar. All 4 of us had the tasting menu, in which we eventually had over 17 different and delicious fish; and 3 of us had the sake pairing menu. We enjoyed every morsel and every drop! We especially appreciated that each piece of nigiri had a high proportion of fish to rice and could easily be properly eaten in one bite. If requested the shabu shabu can be fish instead of beef, which we all did, and it was very good. In hindsight we would have stayed with the beef -- it is more traditional and would have been a good shift from the prior 6 fish courses. Dessert was a very light and clean tasting pomegranate sorbet - a great ending. The tasting menu is printed daily for the fish available on that date, and we appreciated being able to bring home the menu. Service was prompt and informative, although the descriptions were explained so rapidly and the terms were unfamiliar enough that I missed much of what the waitstaff said. The noise level in the bar was quite loud, but in the sushi bar and restaurant we could readily hold conversations. All in all an outstanding experience!",

Given that our second order of sushi came before our original order was served, I would say they simply forgot.  This was not what I expected from the wait staff.  I'll stick with Ozumo!",

It began with the valet who asked if I wanted change for a $20 before he parked my car. OpenTable showed almost nothing available for 2, but the whole place was almost empty. And, although our waiter was very attentive, the prix fixe tasting dinner was exactly that. Tiny tiny bites of mini sized sushi fish on pinky finger size beds of sushi rice. Nothing says no deal like expensive cocktails with huge chunks of ice, precious food, and that feeling like you've been had.I've been to PABU before, sat at the sushi bar, and had a great dinner. The New Year's Eve prix fixe tasting menu was so not great.And, what is it with Michael Mina all over Miami, Phoenix, DC, Vegas, Seattle, San Francisco, and God knows where else?",

I had chef's choice sashimi (6 pcs), of which I especially loved the bluefin tuna and ocean trout, and the nigiri had just the perfect amount of rice, though I could have done without the touch of wasabi in between fish and rice.  The husband, who doesn't do sushi, shared apps and had the small plate of beef skewers, which he said were of excellent quality but too salty.  :(  Dessert did not look that intriguing, so we skipped it.

You won't be disappointed.The omakase started with a \"happy spoon\" with uni and roe and some other ingredients for an umami explosion in your mouth.  From there, the menu went through four courses of nigiri meticulously and lovingly crafted by the sushi chef, from light and delicate fish, to oily, to pungent, to textured.  When we expressed interest in where the fish was from, the chef pulled out his iPhone and showed photos of the fish we were eating that he had selected that morning.  He also showed us the hook used to catch the bluefin tuna we ate.  The meal closed with wagyu shabu shabu, which was fine, but underwhelming after the amazing sushi.We will definitely be back for the sushi and the overall experience!

          "Review": "This restaurant is located in a lovely courtyard. The service was passable, not exceptional in any way. The food was expensive and uninspired. My husband and I had the tasting menu which had about 8 courses, and we also had the sake pairing. The first course, the Happy Spoon was very lovely, with intricate flavors on the tongue. Unfortunately, every other course, tasted like a sushi from a good sushi restaurant. Fish was fresh, but not inspired. No explosion of tastes, just boring.  I don't think the chef ever tasted the \"palate cleanser\" or he wouldn't have served it. The combination of flavors all clashed, too salty, icy. The sushi continued, a little cold rice topped with some mildly marinated assorted fish. The shabu shabu preceding the dessert was awful. Some miniature assorted food items, including a thimbleful of beef in front of a steaming pot of broth with noodles. Then a waiter came with another bowl of  broth with different noodles, and spooned it into this bowl. It was all confusing, two kinds of noodles that didn't go together, a poor combination of juices. Dessert was nothing to write about. How many ways can you say disappointing? Boring? We even had to ask for soy sauce and wasabi!  They brought wasabi, and 2 huge bowls of very sour marinated ginger, but no soy sauce. No one asked if we enjoyed our food, either during the meal or at the end. All in all, it was a sufficient amount of food, but not satisfying or creative. For the most part, the food did not taste like it was just made by the sushi chef. The rice should not have been as cold, and the food did not make me interested in the next course. I, unfortunately, was looking forward to leaving. The cocktail-lounge type music was very loud though we were seated in supposedly quiet \"solarium\". We came here after enjoying a truly enjoyable omakase at Kusakabe a few weeks ago, as we heard Pabu was comparable to Kusakabe. There is no comparison. Kusakabe wins hands down.",

Not sure but it wasn't what I was expecting.  The food was excellent.  The service was friendly.  We'll go again but probably not with a group, I think it might be better for 2 people, sitting at the bar then 4, trying to converse at a booth.",

We shared 2 sake pairings among the 4 of us.  It sounds overwhelming, but the chef limits the amount of rice so that it's not.  Every piece of sushi was perfect, and the tastes were unlike anything I'd had before.  The shabu shabu was thankfully small, the beef very, very tender.  The fruit was interesting.The service was excellent for most of the meal.  Our original server explained each sake and each piece of fish.   But he then disappeared, other servers took over, and at the end no one was around to bring us the bill or even thank us. This was the only negative, an unfortunate last impression.",

All this place wants to do is to get you to purchase expensive liquor and drinks; since it was a Sunday evening we were not interested in that; we came here for sushi and not bottle service.  Following, our order was mixed-up and delivered to the table next to ours.  The diners told the staff that it was not their food but the waitstaff insisted it was theirs until about 5 minutes later they realized the mix-up.  Random waiters stepped on my wife's feet at least twice while they walked by yet no apologies.  Quality of the fish was mediocre at best and small portions.  Overall, a terrible place.",

As first-time customers, waiter gave us a complimentary Monterey Squid Okonomiyaki which was delicious! We ordered 2 cocktails, 1 blue-fin tuna sushi, steamed clams, grilled squid, black cod, dueling tempura, the Pabu green tea and custard desserts -- unique, delicious, and filling enough for $146 + tips.  We really enjoyed our dinner, did not feel rushed, and the dishes came out after the previous dishes were cleared and our plates replaced with clean ones. The whiskey cocktail had a solid ball of ice; the Citrus had a pretty rectangular tall solid chunk of ice with pansy blossoms embedded on the ice at one end but tasted mostly grapefruit juice. Go try it!",

We went for dinner on a Friday evening, and the restaurant was vibrant and bustling. We did really enjoy the food, but the service was spotty at best. Our server seemed to be unfamiliar with some of the menu items and how they were prepared. They also brought us the check without asking if we wanted it first, and without offering dessert or coffee, which we actually wanted. We felt like we were being rushed out, so we didn't ask for a dessert menu. It really soured the end of the meal experience.",

Such failures in the Bay Area have to do with the feeling that while the food is good, as it is at Pabu, its expensive give that similar food is available in the community - Ask Charles Phan.   There is already a lot a very good Japanese food in the City.  If this had been a twist on Polish food, you might have something unique.Pabu's food was very good.  I like the small plate format for sharing.   The space was beautiful.  I just was not amazed.   This is more feigned criticism than feigned praise.  Enjoyed it but probably won't be gong back soon as there are other places to try.",

The Omakase was nothing more than a glorified sushi dinner.  The sushi was indiscernible and so lacking in flavor, we had to dip it in soy sauce.  The dessert was nothing more than a scoop of ice cream and cut up fresh Asian pears, no talent nor creativity involved at all.  Service was poor.  The very small teapot for two people had to be filled five times during the meal and each time we had to find a server to fill it.  The last two fillings, we had to ask two different servers.  For a wonderful Omakase experience I recommend Morimoto in Napa, Wakuriya in San Mateo or Ame in SF.",

The other food was also super well prepared, but not the most innovative, knock your socks off food we're used to from Mina. There is no equivalent of Lobster Pot Pie or Lobster Corn Dogs in terms of pushing the envelope. With that said, I would go back again. Maybe my expectations for a Mina restaurant are too high.",

The staging between the kitchen and sushi bar seemed a little off - dishes came out of sequence at different intervals.  A large table of screaming kids almost ruined our experience, but they left eventually.  The small deuce (for two)  table meant we right next to another small deuce table and we practically joined in their conversation.  The high-margin wine and sake list  is overpriced.  The benchmark is 2.5 times wholesale, not 2.5 times retail!  Stick with the filtered water.  3% SF health mandate.   Not bad for a newly opened restaurant.

If a person thinks that hot sake is what sake is they should have the pairing to discover the joy of fine sake.

The vibe was good, mixed crowd of date night and such.  Lots of amazing sake and whiskey from japan,  the Nikka Whiskey was the best. The sashimi was so fresh, and the shrimp and scallop soup was simple yet so complex in flavor. It's a place where you order a zillion dishes to share, and let your inner fat kid have a field day.",

She was so knowledgeable, friendly and fun. The food was delicious. The seaweed salad was the best I've ever had. But...We choose the tasting menu but wondered about the pairings. We asked about the pours. We were assured they where much smaller. This was not so. And while I can't believe I'm complaining about too much alcohol it was too much. I stopped drinking because I realized I was a bit drunk. Luckily I rode the Bart so I didn't worry about drinking and driving.

We had the prix fixe menu for $95/person and we had wine and beer.  The courses were beautiful and every single fish/piece of seafood was absolutely pristine.  One of the best dining experiences we've had lately with really no miss-steps at all.  The chef came out twice to talk about our experience.

We decided to try the tasting menu thinking its the best way to sample the cross selection of the chef. Unfortunately we were disappointed. The menu items were uninspiring and repetitive. It basically  was a long drawn out menu of sushi pieces prepared similarly. Nothing to inventive with each piece of sushi and the the worst part was the quality of the sushi was poor including the uni which was old and tasteless.

We were brought 16 different types of fresh fish in the form of nigiri - from sea bream to tuna to snow crab.  Each grouping of 4 was served with a different wine or sake, and the flavors went from very crisp and light to more complex.  After the fish, came a small dish of shabu shabu.

The space is amazing, the service is impeccable, and every dish is thoughtfully prepared and beautifully presented.  However, almost nothing we ate left an impression that has stuck with me for the few days since.  We wanted to try the Japanese A5 Beef, but got it in one of the least expensive formats (two pieces of nigiri \"sushi\").  It was fine, but still not worth the money.  The bill for two people for dinner with a couple of drinks and a shared dessert was almost $300.  It might make sense for a business dinner or a special date...?  I'm looking forward to trying the Ramen Bar next door (owned/run by the same people) - maybe that will be more my speed.",

We were dressed just fine, we were polite to the hostess, and yet we were lead past several excellent tables in order to get to the far end by the service area.  Why?  The couple who entered just ahead of us, with no reservation, was given an excellent table, so I'm at a loss.",

Service was friendly and even gave me a card signed by the staff, cocktails were excellent, but the food was pretty hit or miss, and the portions were generally quite small for what you were paying for.  I understand the small portions angle, but frankly the food was often not executed well enough to warrant such a high price tag.  Biggest offender was the dueling tempura, which was cold and soft.  Additionally, my friend and I suffered horrible stomach aches the night after dining here (we did not share the same lunch, so we just assumed it was from dinner).  For the price, there are plenty of great bars and much better restaurants in the city.  Probably will not return.",

We had nice seats at the end of the sushi bar, where we ordered the tasting menu. Plates of progressively rich nigiri were put before us with a beverage pairing. I was overjoyed, beginning with the Happy Spoon first bite continuing to the peach and sorbet dessert. The final savory course of wagyu beef was also excellent.  The dining room is beautiful, and was filled with a glamorous and enthusiastic crowd.",

Desserts (coffee jelly and soy caramel, sake jelly roll cake) were delicious without being too heavy. and they are normal portions for desserts. The Ramen Bar next door to Pabu has the same sized jelly roll cake slice for half the price that Pabu charged.  But, it did not have the small scoop of coconut ice cream and the few sliced berries.  We did not try the sushi, but the plates of sushi had very small pieces of fish. Decor felt like we were sitting at a fishing village.",

However, and these are the reasons I would not return to PABU or recommend it, the value is very poor (i.e. the cost was too high for the food) and second, the options are overwhelming. There's just too much going on for an American audience not familiar with Japanese cuisine (other than sushi or ramen, of course). I went for the $95 tasting option to avoid decision paralysis. Hence, the large bill and the less than satisfactory feeling!",

Sadly there were only 2 of us, so 3/4 of the way through our meal, we were stuffed and had to cancel the last few plates. the only thing I would not have ordered was the chef's selection for the robatayaki and the duck. Only because it gave you more than you prob need to taste, and it filled us up and we had to cancel our final sashimi orders (so sad). We did enjoy immensely: Yuzu Kanpachi, Monterey Squid Okonomiyaki,  and the chicken tails. Sadly, we did not get to try the beef tongue...",

The fish and other seafood was excellently prepared. Service was great. We rarely had to wait more than a few minutes in between courses. The shabu shabu at the end left a little to be desired re: portion size of american Wagyu beef, but was delicious. The dessert, sorbet and fresh fruit covered in carbonated Saki was delicious. Overall it was a delicious experience, but at over $300 for two, I probably will reserve it for extra special occasions. Those with expense accounts will probably find this place appealing.",

Decor is sleek, modern & Japanese minimalist (beautiful & expected). I received THE friendliest welcome EVER in a Japanese restaurant, thanks to the general manager, my server, & sushi chef. It made a difference.  I splurged on the tasting menu; so glad I did. 1st bite, the Happy Spoon oyster: I was swimming in the ocean! Every other bite afterwards, heavenly. Would've appreciated 1 more seared nigiri, but all in all spectacular: each bite had a perfect balance (no overwhelming smear of wasabi). Pabu & Roka Akor will be in competition, but Pabu has the upper hand due to service & professionalism of Mina & Tominaga.",
