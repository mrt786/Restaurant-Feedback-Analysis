Also, the chicken dish was full of potatoes and very little chicken. And the crispy chicken potstickers had a heavy sauce on them, and it was totally overdone. Last time visiting for us",

They gave us one glass per person for the water and the large beer we were splitting. Had to ask for glasses for the water. They brought us the main dish before the appetizer and without the side of rice. Not sure why any restaurant in a city like San Francisco would think that\u2019s ok. We asked them to serve the dishes in the intended order: appetizer followed by main, alongside rice. Not unreasonable expectation. Ambiance was not fitting for a restaurant neighboring some of the top hotels in the city. Really bad experience.",

It was the meal I wanted after having my daughter. We went a year ago and were so disappointed. So I was hoping Fang would have some of Nan Kings dishes, they did. As luck would have it Peter was there and he remembered my husband and they chatted and he ordered for us. My daughter is gluten free and Peter had the chefs make all the dishes gluten free except one. My daughter and her boyfriend loved the food. My only feedback is the sauces were a little heavy. We didn't order rice and that would have made a difference with the sauces. The dishes we ate were apple and shrimp, tofu and broccoli, eggplant and sweet potato, pork spare ribs, a chicken soup (pictured) pork buns, and sesame bean paste little cookies hot and fresh.  My daughter had two cocktails, a lychee martini and a pomegranate margarita and neither were very good. I don't believe cocktails are their jam. We will definitely be back!",

We were sitting near the window during the day and may not have noticed the green if we weren't. This wasn't a great way to start off a meal. We ordered soda and notified the waiter at the end of our meal about the water and they saw it and apologized. I ordered one of the short rib dishes.

The descriptions of the food I read wasn\u2019t reflected the food we ate. The food generally was very oily. The Chau Chau chicken didn\u2019t have much flavor and the chicken was really dry. The sweet potato in sesame chicken wasn\u2019t complicated cooked through - it was a little hard. The best thing we had was the pork belly and duck buns. Wouldn\u2019t recommend this place to anyone.

It is my preferred way to experience Fang.  The food is exceptional, and they are skilled at working with groups. It is truly a treasure, with a great location and plenty of parking around Moscone Center.",

We ordered chicken with chili sauce and long beans and asked that it not be too hot.  What we got was chicken and broccoli in a white sauce, which turned out to be mayonnaise and mustard seeds. The person who served it to us said it was chef\u2019s secret sauce. She didn\u2019t know. The original server thought he was being helpful.My husband liked beef and there was one beef offering.We were disappointed in the selection, the execution, and the experience.",

He brought out food we didn\u2019t want or like, such as soy braised hard boiled eggs, short rib cubes, sweet fried chicken, raw bok choy, etc. The water for hot tea was tepid as if from a tap, definitely not boiled. I paid $300 for a meal I wanted to spend $150 on. Food is swathed in sweet sauce and all of it is fried. I was not impressed by any dish and will not return.

When  he found out it was our first time at the restaurant. He asked us a few simple questions and told us he would order for us, each course was delicious and satisfied all five guest. It was quite an experience having someone else order and explain what the entr\u00e9es were. It was worth every penny I would go back. It was a great experience!",

We are an elderly group and somewhat hard of hearing - so making conversation across such a large table was difficult.   The host at the door seated us and he was friendly enough.   The service experience once seated was rather dreadful, even bizarre.     A white-haired man wearing a mask came to our table several times - offering to create a meal for the table.    He was difficult to understand but persistent and pesky.     I don't know who our actual server was - as we just flagged down someone who was rushing by when we wanted to order or make a request.     None of them were friendly or helpful.    No one smiled.    We felt like an imposition.     The food was average at best.",

It was a varied selection, all a bit more innovative than a standard southern Chinese menu. Our favorites were the chicken buns appetizer and the broccoli/shrimp/cubed beef (both highlighted on the Food Network). The soup had clams and shrimp and crispy rice in a gentle white broth. The egg/fried rice was finished at our table on a sizzling cast iron pan: a nice flourish for basic egg/fried rice with peas. We loved the citron-ginger tea where the lemon zest has been soaked in sugar syrup. We saw some noodle dishes and potstickers go by and next time we\u2019ll order on our own.",

          "Review": "The only reason I am not leaving (0) star is because the owner was kind enough to greet every customer which I thought was very nice, however, after the initial drink order we never were approached again. After watching every table around my family and I have their orders taken and their meals subsequently brought to them all, my 12 year old son and my elderly mother and I were left sitting at the table hungry for over half an hour. We were asked by one waiter if we had ordered at which point we informed them that we had not and we were still made to sit for another 20 mins while they brought food and drinks to the tables adjacent to ours who had arrived significantly later then we had. When we finally decided to leave, the patrons at the table next to us apologized for having to watch us consistently being ignored although we received not one apology from any staff of the restaurant as we left even after they were informed why we were leaving after not being served for over half an hour.Due to my family and I being on vacation and staying at the nearby W hotel, we were looking forward to eating at this location given the amazing reviews but we ended up having to walk a half a mile in the rain to eat. I am beyond disappointed and embarrassed by this experience and I hope that no one else has to go through this and will challenge this establishment to treat all of its patrons fairly and equitably especially due to Fangs representing this beautiful city to the world on the Food Network.Horrible service",

We were surprised by how the restaurant looked dated and messy inside (things stored all over in the open and things stacked on the bar like a work station). The server immediately came to our table and asked if we were ready to order. They seemed to be rushing us and were not very helpful or welcoming. We thought this was the more modern Fang location and expected good service after seeing the show which seemed to say they were modernizing the family restaurant with a big focus on high quality service. The food was really good. But it seems this restaurant could use some attention and some focus on quality service.",

Mr. Fang looking very down trodden (someone let him stay home on a week night pls) wisked away our menus and ordered for us. Sadly I had my order ready because I\u2019d perused the menu in advance, very excited for certain dishes. The staff began placing dishes on our table, 3 spare ribs, 3 shrimp, eggs with cucumber, three tiny cubes of beef, and it went on and on, apparently he ordered us the chefs tasing menu. I looked at other tables and people had massive platters of entrees, sign me up for that next time! Service was beyond sub par, I had to hunt someone down for the check, and the bill was 300$ bf tip.  Honestly we could have ordered what we wanted and paid significantly less!  The restaurant is dirty, piled high with junk by the bar, aluminum pans, supplies, filthy by the bathroom. I was shocked by the experience start to finish and very embarrassed I took friends there, so disappointed. And still starving when I left, as I don\u2019t eat beef, or pork shrimp even in microscopic portions.  Maybe let guests order their own food?",

The first two visits were very nice, including Peter ordering for a table of 8 (fortunately, my company was footing the bill). I'm sorry to report that our most recent visit was a complete disappointment. We had a 5:30 reservation because of a show we were seeing that night. The door remained locked until 5:35 and there was no welcome or hello offered, just an unlocked door and someone turning on their heel away from us. We were then shown to a table in the front window, where other diners were soon seated on either side of us, presumably to give the impression of a full house. What became most annoying were the kitchen staff yelling behind the pass ... and then a crying baby was added to the mix (not a baby belonging to any guests, mind you). Service was brusque, the food uninspired - when you see \"fried potstickers\", they mean it - not pan fried, but deep fat fried. While Fang's steamed buns were passable, the Mongolian short ribs were not.We would have ordered more to taste but the whole experience was a first-class disaster. It's as if the Fang's have enjoyed their 15 minutes of Hollywood fame, and now just want to milk the convention center trade without any concern for locals and the restaurant's reputation. It's a hard no for us going forward.",

          "Review": "We went to this restaurant after seeing their offerings online. What we received was something as close to idyllic as possible.  We were a party of five and we appeared to be a bit discombobulated when a gentleman approached our table. We had been admiring a picture in the restaurant that featured Keanu Reeves with this same gentleman. He then told us that he was both the owner as well as the cook at the restaurant.  He suggested a family style offering that sounded truly delicious. However, we informed him that we had a family member who was Delia\u2019s. Without missing a step the gentleman (Mr. Peter Fang) told us that he completely understood and that he would handle that extra \u2018wrinkle\u2019.  His staff proceeded to serve us the most incredibly delicious nine course meal that was accompanied with a distinct separate but equally delicious nine course meal for our extra special family that was the most generous offering anyone could ever have expected or imagined. Needless to say that this entire experience was a unique one of a kind heavenly offering that will forever have us returning to eternally thank Mr. Fang and his staff for their gracious and more than delicious meal. If anyone desires a super meal with great people , well you found it here at Fang\u2019s in San Francisco.",

We obliged and I wish we had not.  Some things were good, but the volume was unusual. We got a massive platter of sweet potatoes, which were tasty, but followed by chicken with sweet potatoes. This didn\u2019t make sense. The sweet potatoes needed something to go with them like green beans or anything really. Main dishes were very sweet and saucy, and needed steamed rice to balance them out. However, the only rice we were served was in the form of fried rice, which was fun to watch them prepare a table, but the flavor was more like Spanish rice. Overall, we could\u2019ve done a lot better by ordering all the things we wanted. We didn\u2019t get any noodles, which is something we really wanted. We did not get the pork belly buns which Fang is known for. Fresh fish was amazing, but I felt terrible, because the amount they brought could have fed 20 people.  Chef Fang may have just been having an off night, but he seemed very tired. In fact, the whole place looked tired. They have let garbage pile up at the front reception, desk, and the walkway to the bathroom is a dingy and dirty storage space. Overall, this was a major disappointment.  Do not recommend.",

          "Review": "One of the worst service experiences ever!- Made a 7pm reservation. Not one staff person went near the host stand or checked their reservation system the entire time - it was gathering dust behind the very unsightly/messy host stand area. Stood at the door until 7:30pm with almost zero staff interaction until Mr Fang checked in with us. We told him we had a 7pm reservation. He walked away gruffly with barely any acknowledgement. Why do they even bother with reservations? - While waiting, we saw a staff member dragging a tethered plastic bussing bin with dirty dishes in it loudly across the floor, right by tables with dining customers. Weird and very off-putting!- Once sat, service continued to be poor. Asked a few questions, staff hardly paid attention and were not well versed in their menus. - My friend ordered a glass of wine which was corked. Since no one was checking in on us at all, she went up to the bar and was told the bottle had been open for a several days. - No one wished my friend a happy birthday even though it was mentioned in my reso notes AND we told at least 2 staff members, including Mr. FangI could go on, but I think readers can get the gist. Suffice it to say, this place might have decent food (and honestly, it\u2019s not the best Chinese I\u2019ve ever had) but if that is all I wanted, I would have ordered take out. Going to a restaurant should be a thoughtfully curated experience across ambiance, food, and service\u2026.it\u2019s called HOSPITALITY. There are many other reviews for Fang that report terrible service - it\u2019s clear that the Fangs don\u2019t care otherwise they\u2019d rectify this. Maybe some folks are enamored enough by the fact they have a show on TV to turn a blind eye to how bad this operation is, but for those looking for the magic that can happen in a restaurant that truly understands and cares about hospitality, I recommend going elsewhere.",

We ordered potstickers, a chicken bao bun, shorts rib with bok choy,  and the special house sizzling fried rice. The meats were cooked well, slightly crispy outside and nice and tender on the inside.  They use frozen wontons here and dress them up with their own sauce. I really expected them to do a homemade wonton at this place. The Bao bun was acceptable. The bok choy in the short rib dish was not cooked which is OK if that\u2019s what you prefer. With the special rice, we wanted beef and pork but we got shrimp. No beef and pork at all.  The service was good, and the people were attentive.",

We had a very bad server that was very rude, unprofessional. He never greeted us even we said hello to him. When our guest asked his help to take 1 picture for us, he yelled at us in Cantonese ( we guessed cause we didn\u2019t understand) and walked away after he just put the food on the table. We\u2019re very shocked:( Also, he picked-up our soup without asking first, and our guest told him that he was still eating the soup, and he just threw back the pot in front of our guest without apologizing. He had a very angry behavior. It was really embarrassing for us to invite our guests and got treated like a garbage:( We told the owner that it would be nice if the server was friendly or even just smiled. The owner told us just  \u201c What do you want me to do? Fire him?!, why don\u2019t you just enjoy the food!\u201d We were so shocked and disappointed! We tried to continue our dinner since we had our guests. We noticed that they\u2019re super busy, they just want you to eat, pay and Go! They needed the table for the next customers. We booked Fang restaurant cause we wanted to have dinner at an upper class Chinese restaurant , we didn\u2019t know that Fang is just a Chinese fast food restaurant with China town level service. I guess the owner doesn\u2019t care as long as they\u2019re making money.It is really sad, we wish that the business owner should care and train the employees to be professional servers, friendly ( since they\u2019re in a service business) and also it\u2019ll be better if they can speak English too.

We also got the scallion oil tossed noodles with chicken which was much spicier than we expected but still good. We each got cocktails but they were awful. We did ask the owner who took our order which would be better between two dishes and he just shrugged his shoulders and said whichever you want. I would have preferred a recommendation.Service left a lot to be desired. No one refilled our water pitcher. It took a long time for someone to take away empty serving dishes (we had a tiny table).

They finally came when we finished our meal.The servers were rude and non communicative and very unhelpful.Everything was really rushed once we were seated and we did not feel welcomed.The icing on the cake was when my husband paid with the handheld reader and put in a custom tip the server insisted we had not tipped and needed to. She was very aggressive and somewhat threatening. Really very very disappointed with the overall experience.Don\u2019t buy into the hype. I would not recommend the restaurant.Customer service is some of the worst I have ever experienced.",

Both Fang and the original, House of Nanking, are two of the best Chinese restaurants in the world (I'm a world traveler). Their unique \u2013 Hong Kong \u2013 style recipes are unlike typical American Chinese. Don't order from the menu. Ask to speak with either Peter or Kathy, tell them your food alergies, preferences and allow them to create for you a dining experience that you'll remember and want to repeat over-and-over. I have been a guest of Peter Fang's House of Nanking and now Fang for over 25 years. In all those years, and hundreds of visits, I have never had the same meal twice. Simply spectacular!!!!!",

I asked him to make sure we got the sesame chicken (we love this dish), and then we waited to see what we got. It was amazing food. Almost too much for 4 of us! Wonton soup, 2 appetizers (chicken buns, ribs), sesame chicken, 5 spice fish, a beef, shrimp and broccoli dish, and lastly fried rice. We had just enough room for the small sesame balls for dessert.Everything I've had at House of Nanking and Fang is always yummy.",

Both appetizers and one entree arrived at the same time, while the other entree arrived once we had consumed everything else. Not ideal when dining as a couple and you expect to have rice with the meat entree. It was also interesting to see our spicy cucumber appetizer looked like leftovers cut with a butter knife\u2026we thought this was normal until our neighbors ordered the same thing which arrived neatly sliced and piled high.Most seating is very intimate with your neighbors.Safe to say this was not the first time dining experience with FANG that we expected.",

The foos was good, not great. I do NOT like spicy foods though it was moderate they really should make an alternative to the spicy foods ie less spicy.

Once seated after 12 minutes of no one coming over, I got up and headed to the kitchen area to ask if someone was coming to take our drink order... they acted as if we were bothering them.After receiving my drink (canned coke and glass of ice) I began to pour my coke into the glass when a DEAD FLY floated up to the top of the glass... \ud83d\ude33I returned the drink to the OVERCROWDED AND JUNKIE BAR, to let the server see it. Gross!!!The Father then came to the table, very unapologetic, and not very welcoming to take our order and then walked away.The food came out fast but was DISGUSTING. The sesame chicken was wayyyy to orangey, the crispy honey glazed short rib was tough, and the rice was cold.Not to mention, this place was one of our main reasons for visiting SF.What a waste.

Everything we had was incredible, especially the sauces and the fried rice fajita-style at the table, we had never experienced anything like that. The service was typical of a busy Chinese restaurant in the way that it's not about the service, it's about the food.

They didn\u2019t bring water for another 10 minutes. They brought our food a while later before bringing napkins and utensils. The food was super salty with an excessive amount of sauce. It was hard to eat, so we didn\u2019t finish any dish. We asked for the check, but was completely ignored for 20 minutes. Unacceptable experience. DO NOT EAT HERE!!!",

Everything came out at once. We had to combine foods onto one plate to make room on our table. Not once did anyone come to see how we were! We managed to flag someone over and order a 2nd drink, but sunrise.. didn't get it. The check was delivered before or meal was finished and we felt like we were just rushed in and get out!

I called the waiter over and he said that\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to come.A few key notes, the restaurant was dusty and in short, dirty.

We asked the server about 10 minutes after waiting and he said it was coming. Then, Peter Fang asked us how everything was and we said well, we\u2019ve been waiting for our fried rice and now our chicken is cold! It wasn\u2019t until then that our fried rice arrived and to warm up our chicken we added it to the sizzling skillet with the rice.The food was great but service could have been way better including the servers personal demeanor. They could be nicer and put on a smile. They all didn\u2019t seem happy to be there, which is so different that what is portrayed on their Food Network show. This is the reason we visited and came from Las Vegas to do so. Service was slow for a Sunday lunch with not much guests. Our neighbors on the next table told us that the House of Nanking has far better service as they experienced the same service as we did and this became a topic of conversation.",

From someone who watches the show I guess I expected more/ something different but a friend of our joined us and had no reference on what to expect. They were happy. I would dine here again because the food was very good. Leaving the Restaraunt my car window was shattered at the parking lot 2 blocks down.

None of the dishes to follow were outstanding and most were not dishes that we would have chosen to order.  There were mostly fish based which again most at the table would have not preferred.  The chef never came back to check in us. The clincher was that the bill came and we realized that \u201cfamily style\u201d meant $60 per person.  I really felt taken advantage of.

We were in the city for the night and was l lucky to get a open table reservation same day. Was seated immediately and was served by Peter! He was kind enough to let us get a photo with him! We told him we love the show and don\u2019t know what to order so he took our menus away and said let me handle it. He did ask for dietary restrictions before he left. What an amazing experience to have one of the chefs say I know what to order for you. Never done that before! It was very exciting anxiously waiting for the unknown! For starters we were served the wonton soup which was delicious and the steam buns with pork and pork ribs! Our other dishes were so amazing they aren\u2019t even on the menu! We did have the famous house fried rice which you need to have! Everything was delicious the one dish that I can\u2019t forget to mention was Peter\u2019s version of broccoli beef. It had charred broccolini and tender pieces of beef and shrimp this dish isn\u2019t on the menu and needs to be added soooo good and the sauce out of this world. We even got to meet Long and Joshua I was star struck! Was the best dining experience ever! If your in the city you need to definitely go to Fang\u2019s you won\u2019t be disappointed and can\u2019t go wrong with what you order definitely hit up Peter was his choice!

There was a layer of dust that had to be building up for weeks on all the counters and bar tops.  Floors look like they haven't been swept/mopped in at least a week.  We NEVER got a server, chased down 4 different employees to get service but never did anyone show up to ask us anything.  The hostess just waved at us from across the room and pointed at a table.  Seriously, not worth it.  SF has too many good restaurants to waste time or money on FANG.",

The father ordered everything for us, which seemed to be their preference. Food was brought out quickly with no breaks between dishes. The servers did not check or speak to us. The ribs were the best rib that I have ever had. The chicken bun was good, but a little bland. Dumplings with eggplant was great. The eggplant was really good. Shrimp with charred broccolini was good. The house special fried rice was boring and the low point of the meal. The meal was not expensive and we were done in less than an hour. The restaurant looks nothing like it appears on TV. Food is good but the experience is lacking.",

          "Review": "We had watched the six-part series on the Food Network titled \u201cChef Dynasty\u201d. This featured Kathy Fang, the owner and chef at Fang Restaurant in SF. She is the daughter of Peter Fang, who owns the House of Nanking in Chinatown, recently honored as a SF Legacy Restaurant. House of Nanking is known for updates to classic Chinese dishes. Fang has a more modern, innovative take on Chinese cooking. We decided we needed to try it out and went there for lunch on the 21st anniversary of our engagement.I had read, in reviews, that guests were frequently greeted at Fang by Peter Fang. He seems to spend a fair amount of time at Fang. I assume he is at his place for dinners. It is also reported that Peter will offer to pick your meal for you and most reviewers have been quite happy with the result. As we entered, we were, indeed, greeted by Peter. We noticed Kathy Fang over by the open kitchen. After being seated, we were surprised to have Kathy come to our table to take our order. We had some conversation about the TV show and that we were celebrating. We asked what she would suggest and she offered to make selections for us. Now the menu is not at all the typical Chinese options, so we were happy to be served. Kathy was very casually dressed in contrast to the high fashion with lots of make-up seen on the program. Very low key. We had several opportunities to chat with Kathy over a leisurely lunch. We started with a skewered shrimp and apple single bite. Next came a large pork spare rib, fall of the bone tender. There was a wor wonton soup with tiny clams and pork wonton in a light cream broth. The main entr\u00e9e\u2019 was a chili oil whitefish (sea bass) that disappeared quickly. We also had a charred broccolini. All washed down with a Napa Bouchaine rose (this was a winery at which Kathy cooked for a special event of Napa vintners on the program). Dessert was the most traditional dish of sesame rice balls and almond cookies.We look forward to going back for dinner.",

We met Mr. Peter and had great food. The ambiance was just like on the television show. The decor was authentic and pleasing to the eyes. It was a full room but did not feel crowded. The appetizers and entrees came out quickly, hot and flavorful. We loved the rice dish that was prepared table side. All of the staff was friendly and attentive.   We had ribs, pear shrimp  and hot and sour soup  for our appetizers and for our entrees we had  garlic noodles, signature rice, pear shrimp , chicken and shrimp buns, and sesame chicken. Each dish was delicious , well seasoned and palate pleasing.  Parking in the area can be tricky but we managed to park just around the corner in the paid lot. We cant wait to go again",

We ordered three items- we got two. Then we got a bill, with all three items.  We asked to have the third item, and instead, we got a bill with the third item removed.  Then we told them we wanted the pot stickers and eventually got them.  It was hard to get the staff attention to get more water or soda, so we eventually gave up and settled for paying for the meal and leaving.  Running a restaurant is hard, but the staff could listen a little more to the guests.... the food itself was fantastic- and they have a great \"at the table\" fried rice I have never seen before- the next table got it, and I sort of wish we had given that a try.

The host desk was full of paperwork stacked halfway up the wall. We were seated in a cramped corner with very little room between us and the next table. We had to ask for service multiple times to no avail.  I believe we asked 3 people before a server finally arrived at our table. We ordered the duck bao (strange texture to duck. It is Not roasted as I would have expected). The sesame chicken - very little to no sauce on it, so just cornstarch fried chicken bits with sesame seeds, melt in your mouth pork belly was ok, and the fried rice that had very little flavor. It was fun to see, but just not much flavor rice and eggs with a few bits of bell pepper. There were no other veggies like you expect in fried rice. Overall, I had expected so much more and was fairly disappointed.",

We were a party of two and seated at table jammed against the wall in a row of very tightly packed two person tables.  Taking out 1 or 2 of the tables would have made the seating a lot more comfortable.  When we finally ordered, our food and drinks were served haphazardly.  First came one of the appetizers, then one of the entrees.  We had to ask for our drinks because they hadn't arrived yet.  We actually waved down a server for the table next to us since they were almost done with their meal and still hadn't gotten their drinks.  Finally our drinks arrived, followed by the other entree and lastly, the second appetizer.  We had ordered rice, and requested it a second time, but never came.  We didn't have to ask for the check which was delivered while we were still eating.  I would call the dining experience the very minimum definition of service.  Also in front of the food pickup area on the floor in full view were two containers where dirty dishes were dumped.  Would I go there again for dinner?  Doubtful.  Takeout?  Maybe.",

We were finally shown to a table after the owner came and asked us how many were in our party, and after several minutes without a waiter/waitress, he came a took our order. When the food arrived, the server just told us what each dish was, and disappeared. We had to call someone over to ask for water, and take out containers at the end of the meal.Service was so bad I was tempted not to leave any tip!

Peter Fang took care of us and brought us what he thought we would like which we really enjoyed.  However, it seemed as though 2 of the dishes had the same sauce and were pretty saucy.  I guess I like the food to shine more with less sauce.  Just a personal preference.  Also there is very little room for parties of 2.  There were 5 tables up against the wall with seating for 2 people at each and probably 5 inches between the tables.  It would be necessary to move the table in order to get in and out.  We made friends quickly!  LOL!  And unfortunately that did not make for us to have a leisurely dinner.  We are 2 to 3 hour dinner people and this restaurant does not seem to encourage that at all unless maybe you are a large table of guests.  Its kind of eat and out.  We will be planning to try the original Peter Fang restaurant The House of Nanking and are looking forward to that.",

We had 5-6 dishes, all of which were delicious, especially the broccoli and the bao buns. There's still a little confusion among the front of house staff- one person in our party had to ask fro their cocktail repeatedly, but everything else went very smoothly, with dishes being brought out at intervals. The restaurant was full, so there was some noise of chatter, but we were able to hold a conversation across a large round table with no problem. If you're feeling adventurous, I highly recommend putting yourself in the hands of the staff.",

With soft sweet buns.  He only brought us chicken.  So did not tast the duck or the porkNext dish were fried spicy pot stickers that we did not like.  It was deep fried, spiced with Mexican spices and did not meet my expectations of Chinese fusionNext was a fried gailon (Chinese broccoli ) with beef,  way too salty, and sweet,  the freshness of the gailon was lost in the sauce.The specialty white fish in sauce with bok choy, was too salty and too sweet, and heavy handed with oyster sauce.Specially. Fried rice, nicely presented and was also tastyOverall we the food was over priced and not better than any of the downtown Grant Avenue Chinatown restaurants in SF.If we were allowed to order food of our choice our opinion may have been different. 3 out of 5 dishes were fried and we believe that this more Western version of Cantonese food was given to us because my wife and daughter in law are white. They also prefer traditional food and would have liked to choose their own.We might try once more, to give the other dishes on the menu, a chance to be reviewed.",

The winners were by far the sea bass dish with spinach in a sesame oil sauce, the pork bun, and the beef \u201cmeatballs\u201d that were rolled in a hint of chocolate. Sounds weird but it was different and really good. The main miss was the fried rice. The presentation is great but there was a different herbaceous flavor\u2026 maybe thyme or oregano? that was pretty strong and not my favorite. Pouring some of the fish sauce over the rice made it edible. The restaurant decor was a little shocking\u2014 but the energy within the place was fun.

We arrived a few minutes ahead of our reservations and were promptly greeted and sat down.When we ordered it kind of all came at once or very shortly after each plate was delivered which was a little surprising.For appetizers we ordered the fried pot stickers and Bao Buns with Duck and Chicken. The pot stickers were off the charts good mainly due to the mustard sauce that accompanied it was delicious. The buns meh were not as great.We ordered the FANGs wonton soup and that was not at all was expected in a a milk white broth and somewhat spicy. We really did not care for this and should have ordered a more traditional version.We ordered the egg rolls and like the Potstickers had a similar sauce and was amazing. For the mains we had salt and pepper shrimp and the FANGs short rib. The shrimp dish was nothing really special and too much fried zucchini but he short rib was again the winner here. Phenomenal dish and very different.All in all had great service and a great experience. Will look forward to trying again when next in town.",

You would think it was clean when they opened. Food was overpriced and all tasted the same with the same thick mustardy sauce all over it. Items were described as crispy and vegetables were supposed to be fresh but everything was fried to a crisp and doused in that sauce, making it both burnt tasting and a chewy oily mess. Hot and sour soup was neither spicy nor sour. I asked for some soy sauce and they brought out a dirty soy sauce bottle, sticky and cloudy and about 10%full. No attention to basic cleanliness or care in serving the food. Wait staff were hurried and rude but quick to give you a check. Won\u2019t be going back here or recommending at all.",

We had eaten at FANG in the past (pre-pandemic) and the food and service was fine back then. On this occasion, getting service was difficult and took longer than it should have been. We ordered the \"famous\" Peking buns (with duck), pan fried shrimp dumplings, spicy crunchy cucumbers, crispy honey chili shortrib, crispy salt and pepper fish and the house special fried rice (served table side). Our favorite dish was the pan fried shrimp dumplings. The table side special house fried rice looks better than it tastes and the presentation and portion sizes of the other dishes was not worth the price paid.

We had to wait for a while before someone came to take our order, we had our 2 toddlers with us. The lady serving us didn't seem too interested. First she got one of the dishes we ordered for the kids wrong. Then the food was coming out in like 5-10 mins after we ordered it. The food was bland and not much taste at all. It seemed like they just wanted us to get out of there. Very disappointing",

We somewhat reluctantly agreed- our only comments were that we didn't like sweet food and that we liked Chinese green beans. We never saw him again. Good soup, but absolutely everything else that was served including green beans, a fried shrimp dumpling, clams with noodles and a cauliflower/beef dish were overwhelmingly sweet and under-spiced. We should have made our own selections, but I'm not sure that the kitchen makes anything not doused in sugar. I loved my tea, it was beautifully presented, and we had a good crispy rice soup, but don't waste your money or an evening out at this tourist trap. We all left hungry and disappointed. There are a hundred better options in this city.",

Fresh scrambled eggs are poured on a sizzling skillet with a fried rice dome. As the egg cooks, it is mixed in gently with the rice- creating a creamy multi-textured delight. The staff was incredibly friendly, and we met owner Peter Fang, who we then learned was TV famous in the culinary world. The ambience is cozy, business casual, with a steady hum of comforting kitchen noises and clouds of steam rising from the  freshly cooked food. Try the Crisp Honey Chili Short Ribs.",

When I asked for more water, I was greeted with \"attitude\".  When the waiter delivered the check I had to ask to have all the clearly finished plates and serving bowls removed.  I specified that it was my birthday lunch-not even an offer of a fortune cookie.  Over $100 for lunch served with attitude-no thanks.",

Restaurant was average busy so we were able to get table right away, decor was very nice and had a nice vibe about it. Staff was attentive at first but service declined as night went along, because were sat in a corner and felt ignored mostly.. food was ok and fast, but expected better because of reviews, timing of meals were terrible as our main dishes came out right away but without the star of the order which was the signature fried rice, did not show up till we were almost finished like it was forgotten..really felt like they are just trying to get you in and get you out? Overall, average experience, but perhaps it was a off night for the kitchen & waitress, sadly since we were in from out of town, we only got one crack at trying it..",

When we tried to get appetizers and drinks we were told that the kitchen was closing and it was last call for orders despite the fact that we just sat down. I wish the place would have limited the options for the  reservation so we could have gone to a restaurant where we could enjoy the experience and take our time. The main dish arrived along with the appetizer. The staff was slamming buckets and clearing tables to clean up and close down the restaurant within 15 min of us arriving. It made for a disappointing experience",

The baby bay shrimp inside, mediocre taste, and floppy texture reminded us of the samples at Costco. Still hopeful that this restaurant would prove itself worthy of the excellent reviews on Open Table, we ordered the \"highly recommended\" (per the menu) house fried rice cooked tableside. If you are expecting a show like one you would get at that popular teppan grill chain, you will be sorely disappointed. You will be even more disappointed by the taste and texture of this dish. We each had a small portion and could not eat any more of it. The aftertaste was worse than the initial bites. Not confident that this restaurant could redeem itself, we cut our losses, paid the bill, and went down the street to enjoy a nice Italian meal. If you are looking for tasty Chinese food, I suggest you head to Chinatown and avoid FANG.",

The pork steamed buns and salt & pepper shrimp with zucchini were also excellent. Plan on sharing each serving.  We ordered each serving as we completed the previous course.  Other tables ordered all items immediately and it appeared to be overwhelming when all courses arrived at the same time.  The ambiance is more industrial and casual rather than fine dining.  Tables are set with linen.Service is prompt but abrupt.  We had an issue with a serving and the item was removed from our check without hesitation. We dined early Sunday night but as the evening progressed the restaurant became very busy.  Reservations are highly recommended.Our only criticism - the beer was warm.",

          "Review": "This place doesn't honor reservations.  We showed up for our reservation on time and the place was packed with no large open table in sight, which was fine.  I understand that the speed of service can depend on the speed of dinners and many of the tables just weren't moving.  Plus they were filming something for the Food Network so it was especially packed b/c of the cameras and crew.  But we were happy to wait it out and understood that there would be a delay.  The wait time really wasn't the issue.  The real issue is that after they finally sat us, an the older gentleman (I believe the father of the chef) came over and told us that we had to get up b/c another group claimed to be before us.  The make up of our group was very diverse.  The make up of the other group was all male and mostly white.  At on point the gentleman said \"I have to move you b/c they are complaining\" to which I responded \"So you'd rather us complain than them? We're also customers and it is 30+ minutes past our reservation time.\" But he didn't care and we still had to get up from the table.  As we we're getting up from the table, the diners at the table next to us told us that the quality of the food isn't worth it and encouraged us to go elsewhere.  I was livid and didn't want to remain in the restaurant but my team was hungry and on a time crunch so they talked me into staying.  We ended up splitting up our group and dining at two smaller tables and I have to say, aside from the Mongolian Beef Shortribs Wok Tossed with Cabbage etc., the food was very underwhelming.  Plus, while we were finishing up, a delivery came through the restaurant and I could see on the boxes that they were dropping off a lot of premade frozen items like dumplings, eggrolls, etc. The pricing of the food is fair for what you get but nothing about this place was worth the terrible service that we received.",

Upon arrival, we decided to use the bathrooms before we sat down.   The bathrooms  were filthy, especially the toilet seats. Both men and women in our group returned to the table and commented on the foul bathroom conditions. One person in our group postponed using the bathroom because of the squalid conditions.  The waiter person took our order promptly and brought us our food, but never checked back with us to ask if we needed anything.We ordered 2 entrees to share: Ginger chicken and the Sesame chicken .  The portion size was extremely generous.   Each order could have fed 4 people. But the chicken in both dishes were badly overcooked.  The vegetables in both entree dishes were very tasty. In addition to our 2 entree orders and white rice, we  ordered spring rolls.  The vegetarian spring rolls were quite enjoyable. The booths near the kitchen offered us some relief from the noise.Given the overall experience, we don't plan to return",

The couple closest to us wasovercharged and had to get their bill corrected.Some of the staff had their to-go bags of food,their coats on, and stood and watched/waited forus to finish eating/leave. It was extremelyawkward. We were there a total of 35 minutesand spent/wasted $100.00. Poor food, poorambiance - poor everything. We will not return.",

The only \u201cgood\u201d thing about this meal were the appetizers, but they were average at best. Even the wine was barely palatable. The big let down, though, was the mains. They were bland as anything - a piece of cardboard has more flavor. The textures were\u2026unpleasant. And the quality of the meats seemed to be low. The service was fine, not great. We asked for water several times, but it never came. They saw that we barely touched one of our mains (the sizzling rice that has a \u201chighly recommended\u201d label next to it - it was awful, don\u2019t get it) and removed it from the bill, which was nice of them. But beyond that, we felt like we were an inconvenience to the staff, despite keeping to ourselves, and other than asking for water, having limited interaction with the team. We arrived starving. We left still starving. We will never return.",

Worth going for the food alone.  The decor is modern Asian and atmospherically lit.  The restaurant is ... or can be ... an experience.  Chef Fang took our order, as he will from time to time, and he can be imposing.  He rejected one of our choices by saying \"that's the worst dish I ever made\" and really who can argue with the chef.  There was one unexpected change of protein from our negotiated order, chef's choice I guess.   He sat at a large table next to us by himself directing traffic in Chinese, being bowed at by every server, very much in charge.   But the service was bedlam!  Maybe it was a makeshift staff due to Chinese New Year but every runner was yelling at the cooks in Chinese, arguing with each other, sorting things out, bustling around.   There was no actual server for our table, we just flagged people down.   The dishes came out when they were ready over 20 or 30 minutes according to some obscure priority, meaning an appetizer came out last, a side dish first, you just take them as they come.  My Chilean mother-in-law loved the family-owned feel and \"authenticity\" and I think had a crush on Chef Fang, he's a striking older man and strong personality, and she went up to the counter to thank him when we were done in a gracious old-world exchange.   We had fun in an after-the-parade atmosphere but it was definitely not a quiet date night!",

For a city known for it extraordinary food options, FANG stands among the best of the best.The secret to both FANG and The House of Nanking (same owner extremely similar menus) is to go with an open mind and allow Peter (owner chef) to decide what you'll eat. Forgo the menu. Simply ask for the staff to decide. They'll ask you about your food preferences, allergies, hunger level, etc. and soon there will be some of the most scrumptious food on your table.",

We were seated promptly in the downstairs dining area and ordered a glass of wine. Our server was very helpful in guiding our selections based on what we said we enjoy (spicy, crunchy, unique to Fang). We started with the PanFried Shrimp Wontons (6); little bit of spice, large shrimp in a wonton wrapper then lightly fried with sauce. For dinner, HB ordered Spicy Twice Cooked Melt in your Mouth Pork Belly - large pieces of pork with cooked cabbage. I ordered the Spicy Chili  Oil  Fish Filet with mustard greens (really spinach), which was several pieces of tenderly cooked fish filets in a mildly spicy sauce. We then shared the Stir Fried Szechuan La Fun noodles - creamy goodness (almost Italian) with mushrooms and green onions. All were unique, great suggestions.

They handled a group very well once we sat down, but we did have to wait a long time to be sat despite having a reservation. We had added 2 additional people to our group earlier that day and they asked us to come an hour earlier than the original reservation to accommodate the change. That was fine, but we did have to rush our plans and it was a little annoying to show up earlier just to wait for like 15-20 minutes to sit. On top of that, when I went to check in with someone (no one was at host stand) I let them know we were here but there was no communication, such as \"OK we're working on the table..\", nothing... and then other customers in line were VERY miffed that I went over to talk to someone, and they were talking crap to me despite my reservation being before theirs. The lack of communication with people in line created a really uncomfortable situation where I the customer was being aggressively spoken to by frustrated customers because I was trying to see what was going on.PS - TO BE CLEAR : our server was amazing and she handled our group AMAZINGLY and was super nice and I am grateful to her! Nothing about our service at the actual table was poor. The only bad experience was the situation leading up to sitting at the table.",

We booked Fang because of Kathy Fang's fame of being a two-time Chopped Champion that we had seen as foodies on the Food Network.Fang's seemed to be a tired restaurant, with an uninspiring standard Cantonese Chinese menu fare - decor and news-clippings that had seen better days.   The food was good but all the dishes were dropped all at once (hurried Chinese-style) by our waiter who was wearing the House of Nanking T-shirt, whom we knew from the show is Kathy Fang's family restaurant.  I absolutely hate when appetizers and dinner dishes hit the table at the same time - so I'm biased about this kind of service.We got the signature dish of savory meat baos, eggplant and some beef with greens.  As I said, standard Chinese fare, not the creativity of the show at all.  Well cooked yes but standard local neighborhood Chinese food and service -  not Food Network stuff at all.  Disappointing overall but good food only when we were looking for spectacular.",

In fact, we almost ordered a second round of the pork belly buns, mmmmmm.  The post-Covid menu seems cut down as does the drinks menu, and the \u201cbartender\u201d was no bartender...but did a fine job with anything standard.

Was happy To see that they were open, though boards covered windows and there were tell-tale signs of the delivery business in view.  I arrived following a party of eight, and was greeted quickly. I mentioned that I had a reservation though the server did not appear to check and simply pointed to and available two top.  So much for any Open Table points!From that point on we received the most basic of rushed services:  menus tossed on the table, carafe of water, and back 5 minutes later waiting for our order.  Items came out quickly, albeit piecemeal.  Spare Ribs and Steamed Buns were outstanding.We were finished for maybe 15 - 20 minutes before our server returned to ask if we wanted a box.  She returned soon after and we waited another 10 minutes for a check.  It is clear they are working hard, and I hope they will be fully staffed soon.  This restaurant demands better service standards than the House of Nanking, and once that issue is resolved, it will be a solid recommendation.  Added bonus to end the evening - seeing Peter Fang check in on guests.  Have always appreciated his attention to this often-overlooked step, and seeing him here is reassuring that the food and experience remain the priority.",

If you enjoy a place that brings out all of the food at random times, continuously says, \"We are busy,\" then this is the perfect place for you! Having a reservation is irreverent and the servers do not check in on you. You have to ask for EVERYTHING (water, checks, where is my food?) If we did not ask, we would still be stuck in this unaccommodating joke of a restaurant. My boyfriend and I ordered 5 things: sesame chicken, green beans, curry chicken, and 2 single rice dishes. 10 minutes after ordering, we received our green beans and wondered where the remainder of our meal was. We saved some green beans to go with our meals and rice since our food was no where to be seen. Then after 20 minutes of getting the green beans, my curry chicken arrived and it was nasty looking and tasting (I did not eat it). We then asked 20 minutes later for the remainder of our food (sesame chicken and 2 rices). The waiter brought out one rice and said \"It's basically a medium\" and would not bring us another one (but did only charge for 1 rice even though we specially wanted 2 small ones not one \"medium\" one that WAS NOT ON THE MENU). After 5 more minutes, my boyfriend got his sesame chicken. I wanted to wait to eat with him and my food was cold (I didn't like it anyways but still...it's the principle). They never once asked us if we needed anything and anytime we asked for something, it seemed like such a burden on them...",

We requested the \"chef's choice\" menu which means that the dishes served were at the discretion of the chef.  They asked if we had any personal requests.The food was outstanding.  The dishes included a variety of vegetarian options, fish, shrimp, beef and pork.  The portions were generous, flavorful, fresh and seasonal.  The preparations varied and were complementary as a whole. Some were spicy but not too hot.We were all very pleased with their offerings and would definitely return.",

Unfortunately, the table we were seated at seemed like it was just placed near the top of the stairs as an afterthought...like they brought it out from the back and put it in a small open space. Nevertheless, we found some good looking items on the menu and proceeded to order. It turns out that the chef was out on the floor and ended up taking our order...pretty cool! BUT, when my dining companion ordered an entree she pushed hard for him to order something else (a braised short rib dish, I think...something they\u2019re evidently known for). He begrudgingly agreed and changed his order. Then I ordered the exact same thing he did and she tried to talk me into ordering something different because \u201cno tables orders the same entrees...they order different items and share\u201d. We\u2019re two grown men who had no interest in sharing plates, so I held firm on my order. She was NOT happy - like it was an insult to ignore her advice.When the food did arrive, it was very good. We loved both the appetizer and entrees, and the prices were pretty good too.It\u2019s too bad that the chef\u2019s pushiness put a negative vibe on what was a good meal. Hope it was an aberration and not the norm.",

I am guessing were served at least six different platers from steak, shrimp, meatball, pork dumplings, fried rice, egg plant and a uniquely presented dessert.

It started with discovering The House of Nanking, and later when Fang opened, I have usually chosen Fang (both are excellent).The Fang's mix of sweet and savory is exquisite. Definitely Chinese, yet surprisingly new and different, Peter's recipes always dazzle. I rarely request an item from the menu, or even from memory, preferring to simply ask Peter to cook for the table. He comes over, asks about food allergies, personal preferences, and then minutes later, the table begins to fill with pure delicious magic.I highly recommend Fang. If you're smart, don't bother with the menu. Ask to speak with Peter, or his daughter, and then wait to be delighted. You will be.",

Strangely, it was almost empty on a Saturday night, and it has always been packed every time i\u2019ve visited before. Nonetheless, the host was aggressively rude, striding away without speaking to us, giving no indication that he expected us to follow to our table. We sat unattended for 15 minutes before finally getting service. The spareribs, described as a house specialty (and usually glorious) were dry and overdone. The fried rice, prepared at the table was mush and flavorless (again, a shocking departure).  We paid our bill as quickly as possible and I doubt we will ever try again. Really sad decline.",

The food is tasty, but the style of restaurant \u2014 not being able to order a single dish from a menu and always paying a set rate \u2014 needs to be prominently noted. Our company dinner here twice the allotted budget, since this was not made clear.",

I did not realize that this is what regularly happens to first time customers until I looked on TripAdvisor after the fact.  We were promptly greeted by the owner and before we could open our menus, he took them from the table and implied to trust him with our order.  What a treat!  Not. He asked for food allergies, etc. and I emphatically explained that I was there for Dim Sum and my other sister was there for noodles and traditional Asian.  So the food started coming out, like a conveyor belt, one dish after another, very prompt, but we hadn't even received our cocktails after the first two dishes of fried and fried.  I do not regularly eat fried pork or beef at Asian restaurants, preferring noodles and dim sum but it was fair, two in our party of 4 liked it.  Finally the dim sum, tasty but not as good as the more traditional offered in Chinatown.  He was perplexed that I was not very happy with his food choices, one sister stating that sweet and sour was not her favorite in which he seemed totally stunned and surprised.  He then left and never returned to our table, apparently tending to other new customers to get \"Fanged\".   My sister and I observed 2 tables nearby who had groups of 4 and were Asian and they were ordering off the menu, they were eating bowls, soups, and the like.  I felt like a target and this was confirmed when I got the bill.  He had ordered double of every sampling for 4 women, the waitress asked if we wanted a \"to go\" box, but no, we are staying at a hotel!  I complained which did no good, so I payed the bill &  left with a sour (not sweet) taste in my mouth.  As we were leaving, I told a group of tourists that were waiting for a table to say NO to getting \"Fanged\".  It's a gimmick.",

We came for a dinner and while wondering and thinking what to order, the Chef came to us and, after a brief introduction of our personal preferences and constrains (we had one vegetarian), he just took all the menus and said that he knows what we need, and he would take care of us. The most amazing part is that it worked extremely well. The choices and the amount of food were just right (sufficient but not too much) and the quality and taste were truly outstanding. And very reasonably priced ($150 for the party of four with beer!!!).Highly recommended!",

The flavors were fantastic and each dish was prepared pretty much perfectly. Delicious vegetables and meats and dumplings and... we wished we had larger stomachs. The portions were perfect so everyone felt they got plenty of each dish and still have a bit left over in case someone wanted to reach beyond their capacity. :) The ambiance was just right for a party of 5 or 6, making the group feel welcome and able to sit without being crowded. The table was perfect size to hold the dishes being served yet we weren't so far apart we couldn't visit and the room was not soo quiet we felt we were disrupting others or so noisy we couldn't hear each other. The art in this place is amazing too! We loved it all!  I use this place to impress my friends from out of town and this place continues to deliver! Definitely going back!!",

The lamps, the statues, everything is covered with dust, not sure when they changed their filters last I think never... We were very surprised nothing is said or done yet.

There were 6 of us and we had seven or eight sharable dishes. Each was outstanding. We especially liked the house fried rice which arrived on a super-hot dish on which the waitress poured an egg mix. The egg cooked on the dish and she stirred it into the rice. Delicious. The duck in sweet buns and the beef nuggets were wonderful. We were there on a Sunday evening and it was not crowded so it was not noisy. Definitely would recommend it.",

Some of the wait staff just told us to \"Wait\" and walked away and others gave us a bit more detail on what was happening with the parties currently wrapping up. Once we got seated, Chef Fang came over and asked us if we trusted him to let him just bring food to our table (since we were a larger party and coordinating items would have been difficult we went ahead and said yes). We had a short discussion on dietary needs and food preferences and were pleasantly surprised with all of his choices. There was some overlap with items we had wanted to try so this worked out well and we really enjoyed items we would not have ordered ourselves. While service wasn't great at the beginning (we had to ask to be given menus), it quickly picked up once Chef Fang took over. Food was coming in fresh from the kitchen, drinks were being re-filled and we felt generally well-taken care of. Definitely will be back (but maybe on a less busy night).",

His passion for food, his creativity in elevating traditional Chinese dishes, and his commitment to using only the freshest ingredients make his restaurant a standout. Going to Fang is always like going to a good friend's house. We always leave full, satisfied, and thinking of our next visit.",

We wanted to go to a casual Asian restaurant for dinner and Fang came up with some good reviews. Once we showed up for our reservation, we waited around 10 minutes to get the table ready. The restaurant was half full and very loud with Chinese music playing over the speakers. I felt like I was in China which I loved. The service was a little weird because when the hostess took us to our table, she moved the table next to us where people were eating. They were shocked because they weren't told anything. An older gentlemen came over and asked us if we had eaten at the restaurant before and when we said \"no\", he walked away. Anyway, we ordered walnut shrimp, hot and sour soup and brown rice which were all delicious. I would go back only because the food tasted pretty authentic.",

          "Review": "Booked a table for six friends.  Was hoping it wasn\u2019t too loud.  Unfortunately the music was turned up and the speaker was right over our table.  When we mentioned it they didn\u2019t just turn it down they turned it off.  Which really helped.  Still noisy (we were right by the kitchen which is out in the open) but not too bad.Food was excellent.  As others have mentioned, the owner offers to curate your meal.  And he\u2019s pretty aggressive about it.  We would have needed to push back hard to have ordered off the menu.  But we figured it was worth giving in and going with whatever came our way.  We tell him that one person didn\u2019t eat seafood.  They didn\u2019t listen.  A shrimp dish was brought anyway.  Ended up with LOTS of food.  And it came out insanely fast.  That was probably the only real negative of the evening.  We were hoping to have a relaxed dinner and the food was fast and furious.  I\u2019m not even sure how many dishes we ended up with, maybe eight for the six people at the table.  Included a soup, a fried rice, shrimp, pork ribs, short ribs, snow peas, etc.  There was nothing about the food that was \u201cstandard Chinese restaurant\u201d fare.  All of it was interesting and thoughtful.Everything was excellent.  The only problem came with the fried rice, which they fry at your table.  The platter they used to fry it was way too hot and burned the rice, which made it inedible.  When we brought that to their attention, the took it away and brought another.The cost of the meal was a complete mystery until the bill showed up.  Ended up being a little over $50 a person with tax and tip (not including alcohol).  Worth every penny.  You could certainly eat a little cheaper by ordering off the menu. Most entrees are around $20.  So even with an entree and an appetizer, you could get out of there for under $40 by ordering off the menu.But I would absolutely go again and leave my ordering up to the owner. Every last dish was great and well worth the price.",

The menus were grimy and so old they were taped up. The kitchen staff were speaking loudly to each other. Two of the guests wanted to stay as they were traveling that night and didn\u2019t want to spend the time looking for other options. The owner/waiter started talking about how we didn\u2019t need to order from the menu and that he would do something special for us. I follow a vegan diet so I told him I wasn\u2019t interested. Then he switched from English to Chinese. I told him I didn\u2019t understand. He then muttered in English and accused me of not wanting to talk to him and walked away. His behavior was bizarre and menacing. Regrettably, we stayed and  had mediocre and overpriced food. All the items were deep fried though that was not how they were described on those decrepit menus. There\u2019s a claim on their site that the daughter is the chef. Not so. I don\u2019t tend to write negative reviews but the experience we had at Fang was so very bad, that I felt compelled to share this experience. This is the worst restaurant I\u2019ve ever reserved through Open Table. We should have gone to Hakkasan or Mister Jiu\u2019s, where diners are treated as guests and the food is sublime. We stayed at one of the top hotels in San Francisco and should have asked about this restaurant before we went. We recounted our experience to our concierge and she said that her colleagues had warned her about avoiding this restaurant.",

We ordered the house noodles with pork, the eight treasure salad (didn\u2019t find any treasures) and the xiao long bao.  Except for the xiao long bao the food can be completely described as sweet and salty.  No subtlety, no finesse.  I will say it\u2019s still a step up from Panda Express in terms of quality and authenticity but not much.  I am Chinese myself so maybe I expected too much.  A lot of people did seem to be having fun (New Years Eve) so perhaps we didn\u2019t order well but we were quite disappointed.  What we ordered seemed pretty basic and should have been better executed.  The room seemed understaffed.

We'd looked at the menu for a bit and decided what we wanted, then Fang came over, introduced himself and recommended we let the chefs create our meal, so we did. Dishes were good and varied; pork buns, whitefish with greens, sauteed snowpeas & seseame seeds, beef bok choi (delish!), curried tofu, sesame chicken, fried rice...all dishes were very tasty, but not enough for our table of mostly teen boys. We ordered extra chow mein which helped, but ultimately we all went home still hungry. The waitstaff was busy, though the place wasn't full to capacity yet. I would try it again, but I wasn't blown away.",

The kids didn\u2019t even touch it.  The owner picked our menu.   He didn\u2019t ask if we had allergies or restrictions.   He insisted.  I asked for chrysanthemum tea and were talked into jasmine.  Which we didn\u2019t receive.  We\u2019re very comfortable ordering Chinese as we\u2019re a  blended Chinese family.  We had to ask a number of times also for white rice.  We had crispy pork belly with a bun. No sauce was served with it.  We were served  an order of pan fried dumplings and only one per person.    The sesame snow peas were fantastic but a small serving of only about 8 snow peas per person.  Crispy beef was really good - crispy and fatty with baby bokchoy. Shrimp dish was delicious but small serving of about 2 shrimp per person.  We were a table of 8 - 4 adults and 4 hungry kids.  Our order came out to close to $300 and NOT worth it.  Next time, I\u2019ll order  myself.   I thought by letting the owner take care of us we would have something \u201cspecial\u201d not the case at all.   It was what was easiest for them.   Felt ripped off for that price.  Lesson learned.",

Loved the crispy chicken, veggie fried rice, soup dumplings, For reference, we had 8 appetizers, 1 large soup, 3 entrees and 2 sides (noodles and rice) along with 4 non-alcoholic beverages, which was the perfect amount of food.

It was a small mound of cabbage, apple with about 5 sprigs of cilantro and a minimal dressing that didn\u2019t really help. The shrimp and apple was good, fresh and well prepared. The apple chunks were too large. The pork ribs were served on top of large chunks of cucumber- what is that about?  There was a microscopic amount of sauce. We had a glass of wine and a beer.

The sauce and bok chit were great accompaniments. We then had the poached fish with spinach. It was so good. Cooked to perfection. To top it all off, they provided us with a table-side preparation of fried rice. It was great!This place was fantastic and one I will visit again!",

We came in when it wasn\u2019t busy.  I knew it was going to get busy in a few minutes so I wanted to get our order in but Mr. Fang lectured me that my guests weren\u2019t there yet (they were outside finding parking) and that it only takes a few minutes for the orders come out. Once our guests came in, I couldn\u2019t get anyone to take our order for a full 30 minutes. He acted like we were annoying him while he took our order and he left in the middle of taking the order. This is not the same person I remember when we ate here last. I could hear him verbally reprimanding many of his staff throughout the night. Other than that, the food was ok... this experience definitely removes this restaurant from my recommend to friends list as it was an embarrassment to our guests.",

The owner saw our large group of eight and took care of us without us even having to look at the menu. We had a chicken dish which you served yourself on a crisped rice \u2018cookie\u2019, very good. Then saut\u00e9ed eggplant. A fantastic fish dish, the favorite of the table, was followed by a crispy beef dish. They also included a shrimp dish and of course, I almost forgot, the fresh pork bun starter, which was very good as well. Everything was excellently prepared. They even served a fried rice dish that was made at the table with a fresh omelette mixed in right before being served. The only knock on the food was that the beef dish, which was delicious btw, was slightly over cooked.",

The smoke coming from the kitchen was really bad when we first arrived, but lessened as lunch progressed. The pork confit eggrolls were really spring rolls and the confit was mushy and the whole thing drowned in a ton of a very tasty mustard sauce. Really not good. Happily this was the only misstep in an otherwise great lunch. The Eight Treasure salad was really vibrant, refreshing and crunchy. The salt and pepper fried fish with zucchini was hot, crispy, peppery. Yum.  Shanghai soup dumplings also great.",

Mr. Fang noticed us and came over and asked us if he could come up with what we should eat. We eagerly agreed and he came up a with a fabulous menu.

First, the restaurant opened an hour later than was posted on the web.  When we were seated, we had to wait a good 15 minutes before our order was taken.  We continued to wait forever for our order and, 30 minutes later, were told that they didn't have the dish we ordered.   After we ordered a second time, we had to wait another 20 minutes or so for our food.  In the meantime, we had some egg rolls that were overcooked (dark brown) and hot and sour soup, which was okay.  Our main dish, vermicelli noodles with shrimp, was also overcooked and oversauced.  Not good.  The bill was $38 for one meal, a cup of soup, and one appetizer.  Would have been worth it if it was as good as The House of Nanking, but it wasn't.  I can't believe these two places have the same owner.",

The house made noodles were also delicious but did not arrive with veggies (although we were charged for them). We also were charged for veggies with the fried rice which were not received.  If not for that, the service score would have been higher.  Pomegranate margarita was tangy & refreshing but not much like a real margarita- nevertheless I would order it again. Looking forward to returning for another great meal.",

When it was brought to their attention, they brought the wrong one. So they had to remake it. To make matters worse, one of our other companions had an allergic reaction to her dumplings and we thought it was MSG. As for the dish that came after the mains incorrectly, they still charged for it. A companion of ours ordered a side of rice and they brought him a whole big bowl. Service is minimal at this place. Mr. Fang is pushy when it comes to ordering for you family style. We missed his daughter Kathy\u2019s presence coz she is always up to par and really takes care of her guests. What a bummer.

Found it through OpenTable but upon making the suggestion, found that many of my teammates had been there.Getting in and seated was a little bit of a challenge, because there was a long line of people just picking up food they had ordered on MealPal. Once we did get seated, an older man, I'm assuming an owner or manager, just asked if we'd like to have our food family style and when we said yes, said he'd take care of us. Food was delicious! We got brought out a lot of things. Highlights for me included: eggplant tofu, fried rice where the egg was cooked right in front of us, green beans. My coworkers who eat meat loved the beef and bok choy, and the whitefish. I wish we could have had more control over when the meal was over. We were done at one point, but they brought out another course. We flagged down the same man who started out talking to us to let him know we were done. Then we sat quietly for a little while until we realized we had to flag someone down to ask them for the check. That was a little awkward but it didn't take away from how good the meal was.Ambience was nice. There were nine of us at the table and we could all hear each other talk, which made for good conversation. We do team lunches frequently, and one of my team members said that this was her favorite one we've done yet. Will likely come back in the future.",

We enjoyed every dish starting with fava beans and pork dumplings, moving on to a short rib dish, a lightly breaded sauteed shrimp dish, and finishing with sizzling rice and a fabulous dessert. The portions were perfect for our group of three. The cooking here, at least for our menu selections, was elegant with robust flavors from every dish and delightfully presented. It lacked the heavy sauces so common with many chinese restaurants. Without question, the best chinese meal I have ever enjoyed .",

We had 10 relatives in town as part of a surprise party...since we were the ones who were being surprised, we had to scramble for evening dinner reservations after the surprise lunch.  At 5p on a Saturday afternoon, we found a restaurant that could handle 12 people for a 6:30p dining date. We were seated on the basement level, which is configured for large groups.  We had an awesome, secluded table.  The proprietor (Mr. Fang) visited our table personally, and offered to \"serve us\" and he chose the menu selections and number of courses.  We had 7 or 8 delicious entrees, nicely varied between pork, fish, prawns, beef and veggies.  It was a perfect amount of food, and every delivery of a new course was more tasty than the last.Impromptu dinner and drinks for ~$50 per person, including tip.  I will definitely be back to visit.",

Four different waiters approached us to take our order so we really did not know who our server was. My client ordered a glass of wine and after tasting it determined it was rancid and ask that the wine be replaced. Food was at best mediocre, service terrible and the venue was extremely loud.

So, after being seated behind the bar, in a tight corner, and where one had to ask the table next to you to get up and move so you could be seated (really strange) we looked at the menu.  We order drinks/cocktails, appetizers, and entrees.  A few moments later one of our party's entr\u00e9e showed up.  When we inquired about our drinks and appetizers and to why one entr\u00e9e would be presented before the starters, the entr\u00e9e was removed and presumably set behind the counter somewhere, as when it arrived for the second time (after appetizers, but still before our cocktails) it was room temperature.  Wait staff was friendly but never checked in on us other than to drop off food selections at random times. As for the food itself.  Meh.  It's typical Asian-fusion food.  Nothing spectacular to write about. Even their signature chicken dish was \"ordinary\" and the sweet potato pairing was uninspired and disconnected.  Nothing was bad, nothing was exceptional either.When the bill arrived we asked to have the early-arriving entr\u00e9e removed from the tab.  They were quick to remedy the situation.

We told the first server we saw (a woman) that we had a reservation. She said she'd setup our table and walked away. Three other people then asked to help us, apparently unaware that we had already been helped. A fourth person then sat us at the bar while we waited for our table. There was no one behind the bar to help us. A server did come up and poor a glass of wine for another customer, but he did not acknowledge us at all or ask us if we wanted anything.  After being ignored and seated at the bar (rather than a table), we decided to leave. This is too bad because the food did look  and smell really good.

The pork buns, open steamed buns with rich pork within were delicious and had us wanting more.  Fang's signature honey chili shortrib was cubed, a nice surprise; we liked the crispness of the accompanying bok choy, but it didn't have much actual flavor.  Noodles with clams and pork was unusual and tasty, although the noodles a little overcooked.  Garlic eggplant with vegetable dumplings were a nice combination. Their wine menu is better than most Chinese restaurants, but I tried a special cocktail with apple, ginger and vodka which reminded me of cough medicine, so I'll stay away from those on my next visit.    We left the food selection to the chef, Peter Fang, who was walking around and happy to recommend options.",

So we did! She told us how much it was, and we thought it sounded very reasonable.  They kept bringing over food and everyone kept looking at us jealously!  We liked everything they brought across and were very happy with her suggestion.  We thought for the amount of food delivered it really was very reasonably priced.  Perfect with the two of us, we tried far more dishes than we would have, if we'd selected larger dishes.  Service was friendly and efficient the night we went, and overall we had a great experience.

From being received by the host. To being seated. To getting orders taken. And even getting more water. Really needs improvement. Cocktails are very strong. I think that's good. But one person's drink at my table really tasted like straight up vodka. A full glass of vodka lol.",

The food continues to be fantastic. Sadly, the service on my recent visit was not great; not rude or poor, just inattentive and sort of careless. For example, we had a 9pm reservation, and at about 9:45, they came by and put the chairs up on the table next to us, as if telling us it was time to leave. Also, as I looked around the restaurant, the once-fresh decor had deteriorated ever-so-slightly. It needs, if not a refresh, a deep clean.Fortunately, the food (we had the sesame chicken and their signature short ribs, along with the Japanese pumpkin soup and the noodle pot with seafood), was amazing. Still among the best Chinese cooking I've had anywhere. Amazing flavors, textures, sauces/broths, etc. Really perfectly assembled.",

His suggested dishes didn't taste well at all and turned out to be expensive. He also misled us into ordering more than we could eat by not providing info on the size of dishes, but his expression gave it away that we ordered too much so I asked him to cut one dish and he explicitly told us he would stop our conversation there and ignored our request. In the end we couldn't finish a lot of the food and the two dishes he suggested were the ones we didn't touch much because they were bad...This is the worst experience I have had at any restaurant.

We were well taken care of (once with 4, once with 8, one with 18) on all those occasions and the food was great.This time however.... all the food was WAY too salty and our server was the pits. She wasn't listening when we were asking questions while considering our order. Was unhelpful in making suggestions (in fact, the other three times the server - twice it was the owner - were quite pleased&helpful in making suggestions). She brought out white rice (which we had to remind her to do after she brought all the entrees) instead of the brown rice we had ordered. When clearing she was leaning over the table and pulling dirty dishes from the other side of the table right in front of my face and proceeded to stack all the dirty dishes right next to me.It was so bad that we actually left less than 10% tip which is SUPER unusual for me (in fact, i can't remember the last time I did such a low rate). I'm not saying I won't go back but I certainly won't be the one that recommends it. Feels like, this past Friday,  they used the wait staff from House of Nanking... their sister restaurant. That place has a reputation for busy, low-touch service but you go in their expecting in (the good, when I've been, has been excellent though)",

Half fried fish with curry, not that great and expensive ($27) and filet fish with fresh spinach in hot oil was okay($18). Chicken with yellow bell pepper came has way too much cumin ($18) and not a good combination. The beef and baby bok choy is still very good. Next time we will order from the menu. Also, Chinese flower tea usually come in a pot. It came by the glass,  too strong and expensive.",

We ordered some appetizers, and had to flag someone down after quite a long time to order drinks and entrees. I was only able to place one drink order, since they didn't come back for over 30 minutes after we ordered mains. I might have ordered more wine, but I guess they're not super concerned with margin? It was a confusing experience overall - I'd read good reviews, I had understood the place to be more upscale than it was in the live experience (maybe the neighborhood? or the branding?) and I grew up going to House of Nanking which was always excellent and vibrant and it seems they're somehow related. But, the overall experience was mediocre and sort of disappointing. All the food we ordered was oddly sweet, except the hot & sour soup. Even the xiao long bao was too sweet; not a dish I expected that from.",

When placing the order (pretty sure it was the owner who took our order), he asked if we had any vegetarians as he could tell by some of what we were ordering and how we were ordering.  Since he could tell we weren't sure about what we were ordering (our first time here based on recommendation of a colleague), he said, \"let me take care of you.\"  So he decided a couple of our dishes for us and boy are we glad.  He did an awesome job.  I'm not vegetarian, and I loved the vegetarian dishes we had (we got a couple with meat for us carnivores).  Really good, tasty food.  Service was mostly good.  Had to ask for more hot water for our tea (more than once as waitress forgot), but really, overall, it was very, very good.  Definitely coming back.",

I have grown to rely on the Chef's special because it allows me to try new dishes and the price is always reasonable. We went for mom's 69th birthday this time and for a table of 15 with 5 children. We were seated downstairs and it was really noisy as there were a few big parties. The food was great as it always has been. The service was extremely lacking because of the language barrier and intrusiveness of the wait staff while we were dining. I can normally put up with that. However, at the end of the meal no one checked on us and it took almost 30 minutes to get us the bill. To my shock that bill was a whopper. When the waitress presented it to my she made sure to tell me that gratuity was not yet included. I'm sorry but while the food was tasty it was certainly not worth that price in my book. When I averaged out the price for the number of people it was over $50 pp. there were five children who barely ate a spoonful.

We have never been disappointed by simply following his recommendations.  As a group, we usually specify that we'd like a \"fish\", \"beef\" and \"chicken\" dish, and he places an order for us.  It's easy, it's fun, and allows us to focus on the conversation.Note:  Make sure you always request the Fangs special crispy shortribs.  They are mouth watering.",

My husband and I were seated first in a group of about 6 couples.  There seemed to be only one person taking food orders.  All of the other couples were waited on first. Finally, we complained and were waited on.  The waiter made some suggestions we agreed too.  All of the tables got their food, each table had several courses in the meantime we sat there with nothing. Again we complained and proceed to receive all of the several courses squeezed on our tiny table at once.  The good news is the food was great.  The check was wrong when it was given to us the first time. Again another complaint.",

The dishes he delivered were expensive and some of them are mediocre. For example, they put spicy oil in a soup that is supposed to be savory and original. Also they put pickled cabbage under duck meat, which is weird. But their fish and a cubed beef are good. And they mistook the only dish that we ordered on our own. When we saw the bill we figured that the dishes they picked for us were kinda above average price and we feel that it's not really appropriate for them to do so. So our overall experience wasn't that good. We suggest the restaurant should really make the customers feel at home and have full control in what they are eating.",

We began with the pork confit egg rolls; the pork was tasty but the egg rolls were burned and the plate was simply dumped on the table.  I ordered the \"signature dish\" of honey-chili short ribs.  The honey was not in evidence, but a bitter chili was.  It went back and I did not accept the offer of a replacement because of the time required; they did not charge me for the dish.  My wife had the Mongolian beef tower.  This was certainly OK--she was generous in letting me taste--but no different or bettor than I can ,make at home.  Two other things to note: the plates are large and tables are small.  We had two glasses of their house white wine: it was atrocious.

          "Review": "This is an interesting place located next door to SFMOMA. The owner, Peter Fang, will ask if you are new to the restaurant (we were) and if so will casually collect the menus and order for you (I saw him do this to another table). He will then come by after each dish (there were five of them) and explain each. When asked whether this was Cantonese (which is our guess), he said it was his own cuisine. The dishes were interesting - starting with a pumpkin salad (really more like a cold mash) was very good, and short ribs with bak choy (which was great). Other dishes were shrimp (good not great), buns with chicken filling (also good not great), and a white fish stew (ditto). Closing the meal was a noodle dish that looked and tasted like Chinese spaghetti and was great. The food came quick so I recommend you pace your eating as the staff were waiting to serve as soon as we completed a dish. Probably a bit more expensive than we planned but it was a fun evening with some very good dishes, several we would not have ordered on our own.",

If you're looking for regional authenticity, I can't vouch for that one way or the other. If you're looking for inventive, delicious, surprising, top-shelf Chinese, on the other hand, you'll find it here on every line on the menu. For our best meal here, I brought 15 co-workers. They set us up in the basement room. We asked them, basically, to \"bring us good food and decide what it is.\" They counted us, checked the number of vegetarians, and took off. Soon after, the plates started coming. Dumplings. Seafood. Veggies. Their signature honey-chili short ribs with bok choy. Their other signature, Nanking chicken with sweet potatoes. Eight months after that meal, my team still talks about it and asks when we're going back.",

We ordered the Peking duck buns, the Nanking sesame chicken, and honey apple prawns. The skin on the duck wasn't crispy and it was served without scallions. The sweet potato in the sesame chicken was undercooked and the chicken was over fried. The honey apple prawns were good. I've been to Fang a few times prior to this visit and have always been happy with the food, presentation, and service. The last time I visited was over a year ago.

The appetizer was brought out after one of our main dishes and a side dish and the second main dish appeared only after we reminded them that we had ordered  it.

A carafe of tepid water was placed on the table and glasses. A menu and wine list was put on the table. When my guests arrived, we made our choices of food and waited for the waiter, and waited and waited. Other patrons were seated and their order taken promptly. Their meals arrived as we continued to wait for our waiter/waitress to return. Our order was finally taken. Brown rice with three entrees. After 20 minutes one entree arrived - no rice yet. A glass of wine was ordered, but we had to ask two or three times for it to be brought to the table. We asked a second waiter for our food and someone came and slapped a bowl of white rice on the table. We also asked twice for ice and lemon for the carafe of water. The final two entrees were delivered to our table. The restaurant was totally full and the noise level had risen substantially. We asked for the check and it arrived quite promptly. We were able to leave at 7:45 after a difficult meeting due to the noise, the lack of service and food and potable water.  It was a very disappointing meal and  Fang's will not be recommended.",

However the flavors on a couple dishes were a little different than expected.  This wasn't a bad thing.  It was just a little different.  Also the food will come out in a completely random order.  What you would think would typically be an entree happened to come out first and vice versa on what you might consider an appetizer.  You can order dishes for yourself but I recommend treating this as a family style meal.  It will give you the option of trying a wider variety of dishes.",

The prices are very high for Chinese food - even such delicious food - so paying well over $100 for a meal for three for Chinese food, with a dirty restroom, dirty floors, general disregard for keeping things neat at the hostess table, the use of empty Canton Ginger Liqueur bottles for water at the table, a broken elevator (either it keeps breaking, or its been broken since Thanksgiving, when we first ate there), crooked lampshades, dirty walls, dusty pictures, all are really unseemly in a restaurant that COULD be truly excellent.  Especially when there ARE other excellent Chinese restaurants half the price with none of the above issues.  If they could rise above these problems...well, we'd probably eat there every week.  But I don't like a dirty restaurant, and we probably won't be back.",

We read the reviews and 50/50 positive and negative reviews.So we thought we'll give it a try.First of all, we've make the reservation for 2 at 3pm!We got there 10 minutes to 3. The restaurant was fairly packed! But since we've a reservation, we thought should be no problem.There was a couple ahead of us and they were seated by the front lady! Then it was our turn and I did mentioned we have a reservation but We don't think she understand what I've said to her! I want to make sure I'll received my points!She then showed us our table nextvto the earlier couple and was way along the back aisle to the restrooms etc.It wasn't the best table we were hoping for but that's the only table available then.But as we looked to 2 empty tables next to ours, the tables was piled with dirty dishes! They looked like dishes cleared from other tables/ customers and just left there! This is so unacceptable and disgusting! So we walked to the front again and demanded for another table! The guy up in front told us there's the only table available and he walked away leaving us standing there !We are not sure whether he's getting us another table or what! So we eventually left!This is the worst dining experience we had! For a restaurant that is located in a prime location, the service really sucks! We definitely not going back nor recommend to our friends!To Peter Fang! Your daughter might have won The Chopped but your restaurant definitely been chopped!!!!",

Took over 20 minutes to get seated in a dark corner downstairs so it was close to 1:30 when we got our menu which was the dinner menu. I pointed this out and was told lunch menu was sold out.  I informed him how we already waited so long for lunch and expected lunch price.  He was grumpy about it but agreed to give lunch price.  Others who ordered at same time as us were already half way through theirs before we got ours.  Friend's veggie lunch was served with chicken not tofu which she just decided to eat around.  Almost 2:30 and I couldn't find anyone to take our bill - or get to go container.  Found them to give my credit card then had to search for them again - restaurant was practically empty by this time.  I only left them a tip since they did give us lunch price for dinner food.

My son and I joined our party within 15 minutes or so of our reservations. My husband had already ordered hot tea, three appetizers and wonton soup by then. When I arrived, there were already two appetizers on the table; the wonton soup came within 10 minutes, the third appetizer finally came after 20-30 minutes from my arrival.  Before the third appetizer arrived, we attempted to flag our server with no success. This went on for more than 10 minutes.A different server then came to our table and asked us if we were still waiting to order or waiting for orders. We were all frustrated by then, and I told this other server that we were still waiting for our third appetizer, plus the additional three items we ordered. This server essentially blamed us for ordering separate times. He then turned his back away from us while I was still explaining matters to him. Shortly after that rude encounter, our third appetizer finally came. Within 5-10 minutes, our noodle dish order came, except it was the wrong one. We had asked for  prawn with the stir fried noodle and they gave us one with chicken. Our son got up to talk to our original server who was at the other corner of the restaurant. This server proceeded to argue that that's what we ordered, but he would send it back. That's when my husband got up and walked over to where our son was. He told the server that that's not what we ordered.By then, with everything going wrong, our son urged us to just cut our losses and leave the restaurant. We then asked for the bill, paid, didn't leave a tip and left.For three appetizers, large wonton soup, two small hot and sour soups and four hot teas, our bill was over $100! And this was represented as two $$.  That bill was an absolute rip off!Even the food was not as tasty as the rating suggested; soups were watered down; everything else mediocre!",

I would recommend asking the manager to order for you, he offered this and the dishes were delicious. Service post our meal being served was non existent, Fang are keen for diners to be in and out of the restaurant as fast as possible in order to turn over the tables. This is not a restaurant for lingering over a meal or a glass of wine. Fang has great food, well priced by San Francisco standards, good for families and groups of friends.",

Essentially she was flat out lying to people...a 20 minute was was not the reality. - didn't receive enough menus for everyone at the table, only two (5 ppl dining) and one of the menus was missing half of the options- our table inexplicably didn't even have a table cloth on it (others did)- the server/waiter tried to convince us to accept the \"chefs choice\" for our meal (and told us HE was the chef?!) We wanted to order specific things and had to adamantly argue with him about this. He took our order and then we literally never spoke to him again. - we didn't have one server at our table but rather a variety of different people who would come and go...and not one single person checked on us to see if we needed anything at any point. - we all received our dishes at completely different times...with my dish not coming at all, even after checking on it once.  Everyone else was done eating and my dish still hadn't come so we just ended up cancelling it. So I basically had cold leftovers from everyone elses dishes as my meal.- this was our family Christmas dinner, so it was very disappointing to have such a ridiculous meal.",

They ask about allergies, etc., and accommodate them.  The good was OUTSTANDING.  Delicious, perfectly prepared dishes that are quite different from your usual Chinese fare.  The Peking chicken was a real highlight.  However, the downsides ( which wouldn't necessarily stop us from eating there again) were: a messily arranged main room, dirty floor, distracted servers who don't appear to actually be trained to wait on tables ( which was a bit problematic in that it took about 20 mins to order, and dishes arrived too quickly and slapped down without telling us what they were), and a general inattention to details ( dirty silverware, a water pitcher from the bar with \"tonic\" taped on the handle, cracked water glass, dirty and worn menus).  If those could problems could be fixed...But the food was stellar, awesomely good, excellent.  Just don't go there expecting anything fancy except the food.",

The waitress brought us fried flounder and asked, \"who has the shrimp allergy?\" I pointed to my son, and she said to him, \"The fish is fried in shrimp oil, so you don't eat it,\" & then she walked away. I got angry and yelled, \"Wait a minute. You can't do that. We ordered the fish for him. You cant just tell him not to eat it.\" So she took the flounder back and brought another one 15 minutes later. When ordering, i also asked them not to use MSG, but they said, all the food has MSG. So we decided to eat there anyway, as we had already waited 15 mins just to order, as they had ignored us even tho there were few customers. Very bad service. 2 of the 4 dishes had way too much vinegar, but eggplant & saut\u00e9ed calamari were good.",

I let the owner order for us this time since we are all vegetarians. The food was terrific, it always is.  We received our bill with no printout as to what each order had cost so it was hard to know why it was a bit expensive and we could not tell if he had included the tip. We left 18% anyway as the waiter had to go up and down stairs. All in all we had a great time but I'll order myself next time so I know what the real charges are and if the tip was included on a party of 6.",

Then we started trying to flag down any employee who came within ten feet of our table asking if they could find our server or our meal.  When the first of what we ordered finally arrived at the table, the sesame chicken, it was missing the sweet potatoes that were one of the main ingredients besides the chicken.  Our neighboring table ordered the same dish and their's clearly included them.  The person who delivered the dish asked us if we wanted some white rice.  We had ordered vegetarian brown rice with green beans and mushrooms.  He seemed to be unaware that it had been ordered.   Some  minutes later our second calamari dish arrived (seemed to be complete) and later the brown rice with edamame instead of the green beans.  All dishes were cold and all were very greasy to the point of almost being inedible, even the rice.  We picked through the food and then tried to get our check.  By the way, later we did spot our server on occasion on the other side of the room or behind the bar.  She never came  anywhere near our table nor  did anyone  in that capacity ... only those employed to deliver various items.  The food was terrible, the service was awful and basically we were just ignored.  We only complained to each other and now here as we never saw anyone to whom it would make sense to share our concerns and certainly we were never asked about our meal or thanked for coming into the restaurant.",

          "Review": "I discovered Fang about 2 years ago and loved the place instantly.  I could eat the crispy short rib dish daily!!! I've told friends and colleagues to check it out.  Unfortunately my love affair with Fang ended last night.  My party of 7 was placed at a very long table with another large group at the opposite side of the table.  Halfway through our meal the waiter opened up a bottle of champagne.  The metal part of the bottle hit me in the eyelid!!!  The waiter had opened a bottle of champagne facing me from 2 feet away!!!!  He gave a very insincere apology while my friends said 3 other wait staff came over and laughed.  Thank god it was the metal piece as the cork would have done much more damage than my blurry vision and painful eye which I had to cover with a cold beer bottle as the staff could have cared less.  The waiter came back and apologized and said he lost his attention hence facing me while he opened the bottle.  I could have had serious eye or vision problems while he \"lost his attention\" and the other wait staff laughed at me.  The actions by the Fang waitstaff and inexcusable.  After our group was completely ignored. We waited 30 mins to have our table cleared and waited for our bill. We finally had to ask for our bill.  I will be taking my business elsewhere where I am respected.",

Based on other reviews we enlisted the support of the serving staff for choosing dishes for the adults in our group. The appetizers and main dishes chosen by the serving staff was perfect - every dish was unique in texture and flavor. The soft bun with tofu was exquisite and when we asked them to bring us one more order their suggestion was to sample the other dishes and not just fill-up on the appetizer. :-) We had an assortment of cocktails as well.

One of these was a a older guy with white hair who was a bit 'off!'I would go back though as the food was out of this world.

I came across Fang on trip advisor and booked the retaruarant based on very positive reviews.  it was a wonderful experience - the owner picked our dishes. He checked whether we had an dietary requirements & after that we were in his hands.  Range of food arrived including noodles, duck, chicken, prawns, & oriental veg. they were all freshly made and  delicious! Highly recommend it! Perhaps slow down on the service, the food comes out too quickly. When you are eating food like that you want the experience to be slowly enjoyed. Overall bill reasonable.  Definitely worth a visit. We\"lol be back.",

He ordered all food for us - chicken buns were yummy, as were the shrimp potstickers.  The short ribs weren't bad, but just different than expected. The chicken fried rice was interesting with zucchini and peas, and lots of egg - best we've ever had. And, the chicken with sweet potatoes also very good.The only negative - one dish came and it had dairy.  We explained that we had told the owner no dairy, and couldn't eat it.  No problem, and they were nice.  But, we gave our alternative choice, and then waited, and waited and had to re-order. . . staff was very apologetic, but we were tired and had enjoyed the meal so far, and the delay was a bummer finish!",

When we finally were approached by staff, the \"waiter\" came up to the table, looked at us with an irritated face and nodded his head like, \"ok, what do you want!\" I had to ask, \"ok so should we order now?\".  He wrote down our order and all items were wrong. Everything was delivered by a different person, and they came and went so fast we had no time to ask for water, or a napkin. Water was never once re-filled. We had to walk to the bar to ask for water and when we did the server slammed it down on the bar. We thought it was a joke, like we were on some sort of prank show. Never in my life have I had such horrendous service. Needless to say, no tip!",

The banco seats were cracked;  the tables run down;  the rag they were using to wipe the tables was suspect.The waitstaff was inconsistent.  I'm guessing that the fabulous server was a family member and the others were not.  The food came a bit too quickly for me, but that can also be a good thing.The pork dumplings were wonderful, but I love port dumplings!The lightly fried zucchini were  crisp on the outside, but not laden with coating, and cooked through on the inside (no cold center) and the dipping sauce was define.5 season whitefish was also wonderfully prepared...cooked just enough;  flavorful but seasoning not overpowering the fish;  tender fish with no bones.  So, I'd go back but hey!  it's time to replace/repair the decor.  You are just around the corner from SFMOMA!",

One order came several minutes before the second order, and even then we didn't get any eating utensils or napkins.  No one refilled our water.  Then it took a long time again for the bill to arrive, and then they forgot about our leftovers and I was certain they had thrown it away (but we did get a take-out box after much waiting).

He took our dinning restrictions in to account and sent out two starters and three main dishes (for three of us).  While one of the dishes was on our list the others were not and all were amazing.  Yes, it seems overly trusting to let someone else make the decisions, but in this case we ended up trying dishes we would have missed.",

The food at Fang is just as good, if not better than China. The short ribs are awesome, and the delicious wonton soup is imaginative. The shrimp and apple dish was just great......and the pork buns are to die for. Truly a great diversified menu. HOWEVER, they need to learn some western manners:1. Do not carry plastic bins of dirty dishes past the customers. We don't want to see how you collect the dirty dishes. Especially when you're dragging and banging them past my chair as I'm eating.2. Do not place the chairs on top of the tables surrounding your guests while they are eating. Its not polite or sanitary. Its customary in the US to wait until the diners have left. 3. The owner means well, however he's a bit pushy. I'm quite capable of ordering and asking questions. However his suggestions of the pork buns was spot on. 4. Its not cheap......$45 per person is steep for Chinese food. At least act the part of a higher class restaurant. The people who bring the food is reminiscent of China. They're going through the motions, nothing more. Bottom line, the food is worth all the craziness around you . Kathy Fang is very nice and from what I hear is quite famous in cooking circles. She knows her stuff. No doubt her Dad has had some influence.",

We each ordered individual plates so this was really off. And by the time I got my plate everyone else was done. We asked for two separate checks and when they didn't do that, and so I asked them again and then they split it up in some weird way that didn't make sense. The food was also pretty bland.

He started us out with Peking Duck in the little white puffy taco like shell. Melted in the mouth. Then we had squash and seafood soup. Both light ad creamy and so delicious. Our next course was honey prawns which are my very favorite Chinese food and these were as good or better than any I've had. After that we had a coconut beef on a skewer that was fall apart tender and delicious. The last course was a huge bowl of sticky brown rice with black beans and whole mushrooms that I didn't think we could possibly finish but we did. Very special and wonderful dinner.",

The food is good, but in a city like SF, which has a plethora of good restaurants, it's simply not good enough. The food would literally have to make me lose weight and grow money in order to justify it's preposterously bad service.",

We asked if we could order those items and they said yes. We ordered 6 dishes; 3 which were not on their restaurant menu. The food was amazing the service was mediocre but everyone was friendly for the most part. When we got our bill, we noticed it was almost $40 bucks more than what we anticipated. In checking each item, we noticed the 3 items we ordered from their online menu was doubled what the price was listed. We asked why and they said on New Year's Day it was dinner pricing all day. However even looking at the dinner pricing there was still a $5-$7 difference in what their online menu priced versus our bill. We didn't fight it and just paid the bill although we pretty bummed with this situation. Not only should every one be notified when ordering but they should also update their menus to be the same. The family next to use had the same situation happen so I'm sure it was an ongoing surprise- issue for people who attended the restaurant midday on New Years. I most likely will not return.",

We were seated very quickly and the staff was fantastic, but was surprised at the owners reaction when we wanted to order from the menu instead of having him \"create\" a meal for us. Had we not read prior reviews, we would have probably left the restaurant. I realize he is an accomplished chef but toning down the reaction might help. Once we made it over that small hurdle it was a wonderful dinner with great service and we will return on our next trip to San Francisco.",

What has happened since my last visit is this place has become a notch or 2 higher that House of Nan King (the owners original restaurant) and that place is organized chaos. Its now a quick in and out place, food was not hot, zero presentation skills and the service had gone awry.

You don't get taken care of - you just get taken.  We thought it would be fun to have Mr. Fang order for us, especially after he picked up the menus and told us not to choose anything ourselves. What followed was a travesty - a flurry of dishes including a soggy and greasy imitation of Peking Duck, something that should have been called Yesterday's Seafood Soup, Miracle Whip and Honey Pineapple Shrimp, Leftover Generic White Fish and Spinach in Sweet Cream Sauce, Fatty Mysterious Beef and Dried Out Chicken with Lettuce. After the soup, everything came at about the same time, in what seemed a pretty blatant plan to pawn off the most expensive items on the menus and turn the table as quickly as possible. Most of the dishes were cold and bland, none was especially interesting and no one stopped by to see how we were doing. For $210 (lunch for 5, no drinks but tea), we got a sampling of what can only be described as things the kitchen needed to get rid of.  I'm surprised they didn't serve pigeon.

Fang is close to the Moscone Center and their lunch service is usually reasonably fast.  I can't recall a dish that I didn't enjoy and a few stand out.  This time I had a stir fry that included breaded shrimp (prefried) and chunks of apple stir fried together with a cream sauce.  It sounds unusual but it was delicious and I would probably never have ordered it myself.  That day I was lucky and the \"chef\" offered to bring me dishes for lunch.  That's happened before and I have never been sorry.  My only regret about Fang is the service and the evening meal I had a few days ago was particularly bad.  The server, a young woman who was dressed like someone who would work the front of the house, took my order.  She made it clear to my dinner companion and me how bored she was with the process, leaning against a wall, staring into space, and sighing as she wrote down our selections.  Thoughtless, is too kind a word.  She was rude.So, go for the food and enjoy it.  Ignore the poor service as much as you can.  And, if the \"chef\" offers to select food for you, let him do it.",

One of the guest said this was the best Chinese he ever had - and he have been to many Chinese restaurant worldwide.  It is another one of those fusion chinese food - not typical cantonese.  I was great and definitely at the M.Y. China level.",

In addition to an appetizer and entree we asked to be delivered to our table afterwards. App came out first, then soup. Ok fine. But then we were delivered lo mein instead of the ordered house rice. At that point we just took it, but regret it as it was super salty (soaked in soy sauce).  The onion pancake and drinks weren't bad, but honestly the service and mixed up salty order of lo mein ruined it. We had to track someone down even to pay our bill! And they were not busy.

Soon after we were seated, Peter Fang greeted us and asked whether we had dined there before.  I mentioned that I had visited on two prior occasions, both of which were remarkable.  Mr Fang smiled, and said, \"Well then, let me take these from you!\"  And he gently gathered and removed our menus.After asking if we suffered from any food allergies or religion-based food restrictions, Peter promised \"to design an amazing meal for us.\"  Just a few minutes later, the courses started to arrive one by one- in good time, and with just enough food for each to enjoy without being overwhelmed by anything other than Fang's culinary excellence.  A cold, zesty snow pea dish was followed by a tray of delectable mushrooms- and then by the best, creamy wonton soup you will ever taste.  Mains included chicken with vegetables, fried fish, barbecue beef, an awesome sweet shrimp and apple dish (a table favorite)' and pork ribs.  The meal was concluded with sesame seed dessert balls.  Every course was impressive.Now back home in the Midwest and after two weeks since our visit, all of us are saying that our dinner at Fangs was a favorite memory of our five day journey to NoCal- and one that we all would strive to repeat in the future if at all possible.  Particularly if you want to to enjoy a broadening experience with excellent food and delightful service, please make a reservation, take your group and ask Mr. Fang himself to treat you to an evening you will not soon forget!",

Unfortunately we didn't get the lazy Susan (understandable if it didn't fit the table) but we were still needing more food at the end for our group size. It was harder to get the servers attention but eventually the manager came out to ensure we had enough.

We had the seafood soup which was salty and they used red snapper which had many small sharp bones in the fish meat of the soup.  The ground pork topped with a drizzle of fermented fish was too salty and swimming in a quarter inch of pork oil. The roasted duck was okay, edible, but not outstanding.

And we'd certainly go again, or recommend it to others.",

If you are unsure what tot order, Peter will choose and recommend for you.  The dishes have a unique twist on traditional Chinese food.  If you are used to eating Chinese food, this place will certainly introduce unexpectedly delightful reinvention of traditional fares.  Yes, we will be back to try the other items on the menu.  The service was swift and efficient.  Thank you, Peter for a wonderful meal!",

While their page takes spots until 10, we were obviously their last customers & they were ready to go!  Our food came out very quickly and while it was good, the whole situation was not relaxing or comfortable. Being in a hotel, we didn't really want the leftovers to go.  They kindly took an entree off the bill, but I would not go back-there are just too many other options in San Francisco!",

          "Review": "Fang is a very tasty restaurant and I have been in there a few times.  On this occasion I needed a place that would easily accommodate 20 people for a casual birthday dinner.  Since Fang is close to Moscone, the freeway and BART, it was also convenient for people coming in from elsewhere in the Bay Area.  I booked via Open Table and then called the manager to confirm some details.  My call was returned promptly and the Manager Kathy sent me some menus to chose from, since I wanted to pre-order some food.  Turns out Fang has a series of reasonably priced and intriguing pre-fix menus, so I went with option 5, a full 10 course meal.  Fang also has a reasonable corkage fee which is perfect for my family full of wine snobs.   The service was great and the food was enjoyed by all.  Our menu included a pot sticker, an open faced pork bun, several vegetable dishes, 4 proteins (chicken, fish, shrimp, rib) and a sesame ball dessert (very tasty).  It was actually the perfect amount of food - some dishes were served on a 1x1 guest ratio, some were served family style and allowed for generous portions.   It was a great meal; I would entertain a client or some family/friends there anytime.",

I made a reservation for 10, and Fang was prepared and ready for our group.  As we started the meal with some tasty drinks from the full bar, we were lucky to have Mr. Fang greet our table and begin taking our order.  Everything on the menu looked delicious and we couldn't decide, so Mr. Fang said he would take care of us.  It was the best experience.  The trays of food kept coming, and each course was delightful as the last.  The two most memorable dishes were the pork sticky buns and the mussel soup.  And the bill was very reasonable and fairly priced (and we left the restaurant thinking WE got the better deal)!  I highly recommend Fang to anyone in San Francisco looking for a truly unique and tasty dining experience.",

          "Review": "We had  reservations for a Saturday night. When we arrived there was a note on the door that said they were closed for private event but a lady was standing outside with the clipboard and took us in through the back of the restaurant. The restaurant was quite full and when we were seated at our table the server asked for our drink order. I had not even had a chance to look at the menu or even take off my coat. They came back a little while later and got our drink order: a diet coke and a cocktail.  The soda came first but unfortunately was regular coke and we asked the server to switch it. He yelled at someone to get a diet coke... But that beverage never came. Luckily, there was a pitcher of water on the table so my friend drank it instead. The same server took our dinner order: 3 main dishes and rice for two.  The food came pretty quickly, but no rice. I attempted many times to flag down another server to alert them of the mistake. I couldn't get anyone's attention. Two larger parties had arrived so our two top table was now less important. No one ever came back to our table to check on us, offer a refill... Nothing. We ended up eating our Chinese dinner with no rice. We were about halfway through our riceless dinner and a different server breezed by and slides our check on the table without stopping. Again, no concern regarding our experience, no offer of takeout boxes for leftovers... Nothing. It was obvious the goal of FANG that evening was to churn out as many tables as possible. We were in the place for a grand total of 45 minutes. I'm definitely not high maintenance and I worked as a server in college, so I know things can get crazy when you have large parties and therefore the service might be slower. But this was a blatant disregard of our meal experiwnce and left a bitter taste in my mouth. I will never be going back or referring FANG to anyone. I'd rather go to Panda Express... At least there I know I'll get decent service.",

Come to find out later one of them was the co-owner.  They finally acknowledged my presence and took me to a table.  They were very cold and unfriendly.  The waiter was a little better but did not seem very interested in ensuring I had a good experience.  I ordered egg rolls for an appetizer and they were nothing to write home about.  I have just as good of egg rolls from the frozen food section at Costco.  The entree was also very subpar.  The rice was not very good either.  I have had much better Asian food experiences at Panda Express and PF Chang's.  I was in San Francisco for a conference and I was very much looking forward to coming to Fang.

          "Review": "Just as OT reviewers said.  We arrived to a room that is basic NYC Chinatown - nothing Fancy.  While empty when we arrive at 630 - by 730 the place is full on a Thursday.   Chef comes over as we are reviewing the menu and asks if we've been there before - but it's our first time.  He asks only if there is anything we don't eat - and then walks away menus in hand asking us nothing more.  The peking duck appetizer rolls are superb.  The honey shrimp was also a favorite - we ordered another of this same dish.  The short ribs were also excellent.  The fish dish we had was the only disappointment.   But I'll definitely return and see what else Chef wants to bring out.    Oh yeah - the brown rice was not great.  And the glasses they give to drink beer are about 4 oz sized for some odd reason...   Secret hint - before 630 there is a happy hour!...",

We came with kids, usually not a favorite of restaurants,  but another positive surprise it was great. We started looking at the menus preparing to order the same boring Chinese  but The owner and Chef took away our menus and  said he would take care of it and he did. We ended up with several really great items we wouldn't have orderd: DUCK BUN Appettizer (to die for)MARINATED SUGAR PEAS, CRISPY SHORT RIBS(absolutely mouth watering),  HONEY PRAWNS( kids loved them).

It is one of our favorites.  The food is consistently amazing.  Service can be hit and miss.  Some visits the staff is SUPER attentive, other times there is a bit of lag between courses or getting the check.  My favorite dish is the dry braised green beans. They are amazing, but truly everything is good.  The sizzling rice soup, peking duck and sizzling rice soup are our favorite starters.  We always order way more food than we can finish, but enjoy the take out.",

The owner was a little a curt maybe because on this occasion we didn't let him pick our dishes and my friends needed some time to find something for their picky son on the menu (he loved the chicken and the brown rice despite his mum being apprehensive about the sauce and saying he only eats white rice)). The rice we ordered did not show up until we asked for it again. The check was left on our table while we were still eating and we were  not asked if we wanted to order dessert (it was 9.30pm).",

He offered to make a special meal for us and only asked if we had any dietary concerns.  From the appetizer to the main course everything was fresh and delicious.  Two people in our party are not adventurous when it comes to eating so they were concerned about allowing the chef to select.

          "Review": "I actually enjoy Fang and think that they have great food. I reserved a table for four, for my wife's birthday. The front desk seemed surprised that we had a reservation, and offered our choice between two tables: one next to the front door and reception, the other in a corner by the front windows. We chose the window seat. We were seated and given menus and the wine list. After that, nobody came to take a drink order or talk to us for at least ten minutes. Finally, my friend went back to the front desk and asked the woman there if we could order drinks and appetizers. She said yes, and sent a young man over to take our orders. We ordered cocktails and a pair of appetizers, and said that we'd order our entrees when he returned. Within a few seconds of his departure, the owner showed up to take our entree orders, despite the fact that we hadn't decided yet. A couple of us ordered a pair of entrees (Short Ribs, Sesame Chicken) and the owner said that if we trusted him, he would \"take care\" of us. We have eaten there before with the same offer, and had a positive experience.This time, however, we only recieved the two entrees, and nothing else came. We had to again flag down a passing server to get some rice. In all, it was a disappointment. The food that we did get was fine, but we were splitting two entrees between four people because we thought that we were getting selections chosen by the owner. My wife was looking forward to sampling a variety off of the menu, instead she only had the two dishes that we've had (and enjoyed) before. We left still hungry, and stopped by a grocery store to pick up desserts and a nightcap. This was a Saturday night at 7pm, when a restaurant should be at the top of their game. The service was, frankly, baffling. Nobody seemed to be in charge, and we weren't certain who our server was. Nobody on the waitstaff seemed to have any specific responsibility to our table; at no point could we definitively say \"that person is our waiter\".",

It's by far the best food in the area.  It's Chinese near a convention center without being tourist Chinese [see Westfield & Metreon].  They have an option where you can give them free reign to fix a meal for you based on foods you like or want to try.  This, to me - is where FANG gets special. We've never been disappointed doing this.  The chefs seem to enjoy the opportunity to be creative, and we have had some of the best food we've had here in the City.The service is attentive without being intrusive.  In addition, the servers always ask the table if anyone has food allergies, so they can prepare the meals with that in mind.

We were clearly not ready, as we had been there literally a minute. He looked angry and stormed off. I had to get up and go get him nearly 20 minutes later so we could place an order.

Somehow they were out of chicken dumplings and the vegetarian version subsisted of peas and shredded zucchini (very bland). Also they were not served as an appetizer (though they are listed as such) but more of a dessert,  given that we received them near the end of our entrees.  Additionally my curry chicken saut\u00e9 was more of a soup that I ate with chop sticks and no rice (picking pieces of onion and zucchini out individually). The ingredients seemed to be of decent quality but the cooking,  service, and presentation were not even remotely worth the cost.  Hopefully it was just an off night for them.",

We went with the chef's choice menu and were ready to be impressed. While two of the dishes served (a fish soup and honey shrimp with apples) were original and delicious, everything else fell short. The the beef buns and short ribs were solid, but not anything I couldn't have enjoyed in a no-name Chinese restaurant anywhere else in the Bay Area. The chicken dish, which wasn't even explained to us in terms of what it was, was outright boring, and sadly was on par with a dish from PF Chang's. If it wasn't for the two highlight dishes, this review would have been a one-star. We expected more given the positive recommendation and the promise of a chef's choice.",

There were a few veggies on the side of some dishes. I would have preferred more veggies but I'll try those next time. We were originally seated in the center area near the open kitchen. I asked if we could move to the window booth seating to avoid being in the path of the servers. Also, we were seated near the bar so it was a bit noisy. The waiter moved us. The owner did not like us taking a 4-top for 2 people however in the end he ended up using the other table for our dishes so it didn't really matter. I was also surprised they didn't bring a glass for my beer. I will definitely return to try other items like the eggplant.

They have a list of vegetables, mushrooms, beans.  And then you tell your server how you would like it.  And then made us a wonderful tofu dish, crispy, beautifully flavored, with crisp bok choi and other vegetables on the side.  I think this is some of the best Chinese food around.

When I tried to move to another table and requested a square table (4 settings, when we were only 2), they said no. We winded up pulling in another table next to us because we simply needed another table for the 4 large plates!",

In this last visit, we took friends who were visiting from out of town (Canada) and we elected to let Mr. Fang (I think?) surprise us with a selection of magnificent foods, every single item was amazing.  We had been to Fang's previously a number of times but always ordered off the menu.  While the food has always been fabulous this was truly a unique and wonderful experience which we will definitely repeat again in the future.",

The food however was mediocre at best mostly because of the sauces used. We've been here before and had a memorable meal, but this time it wasn't good.  The pot sticker appetizers with peanut sauce were fine. We should have kept the peanut sauce for the other entrees. The calamari dish had vinegar sauce which was pretty bad.  The short ribs dish had some unknown crusty stuff on them which hurt the flavor of the meat and the sauce was nasty. The Box Choy in the short rib dish was fine.   The apple crisp desert was like a cracker - not much apple in there.  Don't order that one.",

We also ordered a \"give me a good beef dish\" and got a bunch of beef with red pepper flakes that would melt in your mouth. The pork dumplings were also a hit with our group (some from Beijing).

Don't expect to be welcomed, told about the specials, etc. We made selections based on Yelp reviews, and once she took our order, we never saw her again. But the busboys were very efficient with bringing food, clearing plates, re filling water glasses, etc. Now for the food- delicious, everything single dish was flavorful, fresh & perfectly prepared. Highly recommended the 8 Treasures salad and Five Spice fish. Only regret was not being able to try everything.",

We shared a couple of dishes a Beef Shortrib dish with baby bok choi and chicken dish. Both were very tasty with great crisp veggies and a lot of flavor.

After providing a short list of likes and dislikes and a list of food allergies, the chefs went to work to create the perfect meal.  We started with shrimp dumplings that were the best I ever ate, and it only got better from there. The Wonton Soup that followed was creamy -- a bit unusual in that aspect -- but far better than any I ever had anywhere else.  A portabella mushroom was magical, followed by lo mien served perfectly cooked. Next, the worlds best sesame chicken, and for dessert an apple crisp.  It was like a symphony of flavor from beginning to end.  And the price was also right! Don't miss Fang!",

We warned him of our restrictions and let him decide for us.

I asked her what she was eating and she told me...it looked awesome. When we sat down, a man - who happens to be Peter Fang the owner of the restaurant greeted us. He asked if we had been there before and when we said no, he said OK... I have got this... anyone have allergies or anything that they don't eat?? I don't eat meat (I do eat fish and veg) but everyone else said we eat it all... bring it on! What we had was the BEST CHINESE MEAL of my life. I live in NY, I thought I had great Chinese food. This blew me away - a must stop. House of Nanking in China town is also owned by him.",

They took over and told us not to worry -they made selections for us. We started with some tasty dumplings, then were served the most amazing beef sliced thin. We had to ask, it was their short ribs! We could've eatin that dish all day. The final dish was the pork buns. these were no ordinary buns, shaped more like tacos with a puffy bread shell filled with fried pork in a sweet sauce sprinkled with thinly sliced veggies. we were stuffed, it was just the right amount of food for lunch. We only wish we had more time to return for another meal! You must go and enjoy this gem of a restaurant.",

Unfortunately, the service is no where close to the level of the food.The waiters are disorganized and inattentive. Worst of all there is almost no consistency to the flow of service. One of our entrees actually ended up arriving before our appetizers, and the table next to us (who ordered ten minutes later than we did) received their entire meal before we had even got our onion cake.Mr. Fang also famously has the habit of ordering for customers. While nearly everything on the menu is excellent, he tends to go for the pricier items and some of the specials can be a bit hit and miss.I love this restaurant, but wish that they could get their act together.",

We were among the first customers there that day, a few minutes after noon when it opened. However, the tables seemed to have a film of grease on them, one of the plates on my table had something on it (looked like a big bread crumb), and a dirty dishcloth was clearly visible on a table nearby. I wouldn't have given any of these a second thought in a more downscale, hole-in-the-wall place, but Fang is supposed to be more upscale.Most of the food was not spectacular either. Potstickers and soups were quite bland. The whitefish with 5 spices was pretty good though.",

It would be ideal to have six or more people in the party because just about anything can be split at least four ways. But it's hard to complain about food this good. The eight treasure salad includes cabbage, peashoots, red peppers, spinach, winter melon, scallions, apples and cilantro. Each bite is wonderful.

We've eaten there three times and it's always been great. Food is tasty and beautifully presented. Menu isn't huge but has a nice mix of spicy and savory choices. My favorites include the Melt in Your Mouth Calamari and the Shanghai dumplings, but really everything was delicious. Service is activist--the waiter frequently suggested alternatives, some of which we liked, others we rejected. But he kept our water and beer glasses filled, and the food arrived quickly (probably because we ate early to make a movie at the Metreon). Plan to return often.",

My friend got her crispy honey steak before we got the egg roll apps, That meal was divine for two reasons: the steak was in cubes with absolute crispness on the outside and the bok choy was equally as crispy! I LOVE bok choy raw and have never had it served near raw in a restaurant! I was impressed! next the pork confit egg rolls which made me pause whilst eating. Egg rolls don't really do that generally.

The food came out fast, especially for a party of 14. Either the manager or owner came out and offered to do a family style menu for us where he would bring out recommended dishes for the group. Extremely attentive and thoughful in regards to our occasion and group. We did not do this option due to restrictive diets of several guests. However, we semi orders family style in groups and the bill was already seperated between the people who ordered together when it came out. Water glasses were always filled and the service was very attentive, friendly and fast.",

I was a little surprised by their lack of any concern or appreciation that we were even there. We had a reservation through Open Table and arrived about 5 minutes early. They seated us at a table located directly next to a divider separating us and the front desk. I immediately noticed that the Chinese statues and other items on top of the divider, directly at eye level to us were covered with dust and the divider itself was spattered with grease.

I have to eat gluten-free and dairy-free and they are very accomodating and careful about this (although I don't know how it would be for a sensitive celiac, I don't know if they use separate utensils, you should call if you need that). I go there with business groups of people who don't have the same restrictions I do, and we are all able to find delicious food that we like and can eat. If you aren't sure what to order, ask Mr. Fang to choose for you (he will work with your limitations) and you will get the best dishes! Last time, they were busy and the service was a little on the slow side, but not too bad. I've also been there when the service was good.",

We were seated in a spot that required the guest next to us to stand up so we could get to our seats. The service was very chaotic - many different people coming to help us. The food did come out quickly and the best part of the experience was the food itself - the wonton soup was amazing. However, the biggest reason I cannot give this restaurant more than a fair rating is the fact that they lost my credit card. They took it for my payment didn't address the situation until we asked 10 minutes later. They were very apologetic and comped my meal, but this didn't make up for the stress/hassle of cancelling my card on a Sat. night.",

Mains were succulent cubes of wok-fried short rib and then a very generous portion of delicately ginger sauced white fish and greens.The tea is not the usual anonymous brown slop in a pot. Oh no!

Then we sat at our table for about 20 minutes before getting a menu or any attention. I finally took to just raising my hand and keeping it there until someone came by. The owner came over and asked what we needed. When we said menus, he disappeared. No menus. Finally we convinced a waitress to give us some menus. The same thing happened with ordering; had to keep my hand in the air for about 3 or 4 minutes.The only person who seemed to care at all was the bartender. He was great",

There were 16 of us so the owner of the restaurant, Fang, offered to just bring different food out to us instead of ordering from the menu. He insisted so I complied. The food and service were great but the bill was definitely higher, so instead of it being ~$20 per person it was ~$40. This wasn't a problem for anyone but it would've been nice to how much it would be per person, approximately, so we could decide this as a group. I understand that it was easier for the kitchen, but still needed to know the price. In summary, great food and service but if you're a big group get the price before hand!",

The service, eh, was so so in that there are alot of servers but you can't necessarily get their attention. We had to ask for water three times before it came. Another problem is that there's no indication of what a meal for a group that is selected by the server will cost!

I've noticed that if he sees more Asian people at the table, the menu he put together tends to be a bit more \"adventurous\" whereas if the table is mostly foreigners, the menu is slightly more \"conservative\".

She didn't check us in for our 7:30 reservation, she did not update us 30 minutes later when we were still standing in the lobby. Waitstaff didn't come to take our order until I flagged them down. They didn't bring us one of the three items we had ordered and - after paying the bill - they gave my credit card back to the table next to us.

The service was quite poor with waiters not speaking English, no checking if everything was ok or whether wanted more drinks etc. Normally I am quite happy with Chinese style service as it is quick and efficient but if not quick nor efficient and it a more upscale setting it just brings the whole experience down.

Beef fish and vegetarian dished were all very good.Overall service could certainly be snappier - we had booked but still waited over 20 minutes for our table but in the overall judgemet this didnt massively affect our rating.

The sweet sesame chicken was extremely dry and the sauce was so salty it was barely edible. We also ordered the pot stickers. Average, but expected more. They were not crispy, but soggy. The hot and sour soup was good. Atmosphere wasn't bad, a bit out of the way from the financial district. There's a reason why the place was fairly empty. Won't be going back anytime soon!!",

Snappy flavours, and unexpected ingredients like carmelized red onions made FANG a preferred alternative to China Town Chinese. We had Green Beans, Eggplant, Whitefish, Chow Mein with chicken, Mushroom and Prawns. The food was not too heavy, plus we got great guidance from our waiter, who even suggested a less expensive dish to replace one we had selected--which of course made us trust his guidance. Also portion sizes were perfect--we left with NO take out containers and everyone was full but not stuffed. The only complaint was the menu font was small and the lighting was low, bring your magnifying glasses. :)We will dine here again.",

Even with a reservation we had to wait a bit standing in the cramped foyer. Once we sat down, the staff moved briskly to get food on the table. It is crowded and noisy, but that is because the food is good and lots of people obviously want it! All in all a successful meal. Thanks.",

The food is superior to your run-of-the-mill Chinese eatery, and the decor is gorgeous, but the service does not match its quality and ambiance. Our waiter was knowledgeable and helpful with his recommendations, but was not very attentive. The wait staff and food runners often congregated to chit-chat in the dining room. We saw more of a distinguished-looking gentleman whom we assumed was Mr. Fang checking up on us and other diners. I had to practically trip our waiter to make him stop at our table every time I needed something - water, tea, the check. Go if you're in the area, but don't go out of your way.",

We read that the chef enjoys being asked to feed the table whereupon he asks just a few questions about favorite proteins, allergies, level of spice. Then you just sit back and enjoy each course as it arrives. I thought I might be full before the last course arrived but it worked out just fine. You leave the place full but not stuffed, and happy that you ate several things that you wouldn't have ordered on your own.

We allowed the chef/owner to choose for us, and the steamed fish with spinach was delicious. However, the wonton soup with clams and the crispy beef salad both disappointed. The soup was gummy and had too much coconut in it, and not enough clam. The salad confused us, since the beef tasted more like lamb.

The Shanghainese Soup Dumplings were made to perfection and each sat on a slice of cucumber for that added crunch and protection from breakage. The roasted Peking Duck Buns were quite sublime with perfect slices of duck nested in individual steam buns.The service, however, was quite a different story. This one particular waiter seemed to possess a service mantra of Jekyll and Hyde, particularly when I tried to figure out seating. When we finally sat down, the meal began with a four star table service, but the third dish, it quickly fell to one star where courses were \"dropped\" onto the table and attention were shied away from our table as they began closing out at 9pm.",

For instance, the typical \"black bean clams\" usedpreserved olives as the black bean which gave the dish a different flavor profile. However, the dish was still too salty. The fish soup had a slight spicy/hot flavor kick which again made the soup's flavor profile unexpected and interesting.

The dough of Shanghai soup dumplings was too thick, the vinegar dipping sauce was made of dark vinegar instead of red vinegar and too heavy. We had a chicken-choy dish and the choy was surprisingly served intentionally cold. Not appealing. The Mongolian beef tower was the best of the three dishes. Tender slices of beef stir fried with carmelized red onions and the fragrance of smoked peanut oil.",

I had heard a sister restaurant had opened in SOMA, and finally got a chance to try it. The wonderful tastes were still there, although I couldn't find the Tsing Dao Chicken or Shrimp on the menu. But the sauteed peappods were wonderful, the mushrooms still tasty, and the lettuce cup fish a wonderful combination of cool and hot. And as is always the case with the Nanking food, my tastebuds felt energized. I missed some of the Chinatown ambience of the original restaurant, but it was nice to have a bit more room at the table and not feel so squeezed into place",

The lettuce wrap with shrimp was delicious (it was with beef that i had intended to eat). The most delightful thing about my meal was the Blossoming tea.

The steamed pork dumplings were good, but the sauce on top of them was too sweet. Same with the eggplant tofu and mushrooms in black bean sauce; the sauce was too sweet. I don't think black bean sauce should be sweet and I do not like sweet Chinese food. Thank goodness for the chili oil on the table. The house made egg noodles were chewy (in a good way), flavorful, and I'll definitely get that again. I'll try this place again for lunch and I'll makes sure to tell the waiter - not sweet after placing my order.",

If you care about the service you get, since it is a restaurant after all, then FANG leaves a lot to be desired. They did work with us on our seating, since the other half of our party was 45 mins late, so I really appreciated their flexibility. But we sat at the bar for the longest time before anyone acknowledged our presence. And then once we were seated, the servers seem to be multitasking to the point of not really paying attention to anyone. If I'm paying good money for food, I expect to be paid attention to. We also observed the chef/owner yelling at the kitchen staff at one point - not good in an open kitchen!",

The Peking Buns with duck were also great but at $3.50 each for 3 bites seemed a bit precious. The wok stirred pork suggested by the owner was also tasty but the pork chunks were rock hard and cold, suggesting they had been just added to the dish and not cooked. At the end, the waitress stacked all the dishes and garbage in the center of the table so she could carry it all in one trip. Not an appetizing image to finish the meal. Water refills had to be requested.Despite all this, I'd give it one more try because of the different approaches to traditional Chinese fare.",

When we first sat down, the waitress immediately assumed we'd be having beer and their particular brand at that, very cheeky. However, the food was good.

Owner came over right away and said he would take care of us. Okay... I wanted steamed vegetables with chicken. Instead, they served the greasiet green beans and chicken I have ever had-- practically inedible. Five people in my party, no one ordered drinks or alcohol, appetizers, or dessert, and the bill was over $85. Rip off. On a plus side, two in my party liked the shortribs. This is not Chinese food. This is Westernized takeout $5 takeout served as $16 white porcelain entrees.Will not be back. Still, it you need to entertain a client after work..the atmosphere is a +",

A lot of Chinese places typically use MSG, but Fang's uses a LOT. We felt like zombies aterwards and this was the worst MSG experience I ever had. I already wrote a Yelp review on this place because I really think people ought to know how MSG affects you.

The owner will dissuade you from ordering from the menu and promised to put together a few dishes to your liking, and then charge you more for it. So, you end up not knowing what you are going to eat, have to accept what they serve you, and have to pay for it later. He probably just recommended the same things to every table so he can manage inventory in the kitchen. I wouldn't mind that if the food was good.

We had great conversations over the course of 2.5 hours and didn't have to worry about ordering or any of that. Small plates of great food just kept coming!All for $25/head (excluding all the Tsing Tao and Sake we drank, taxes and gratuity). Amazing.",

While the traditional menu fare was decently taste (sesame chicken), all of the special chef surprises were either tasteless or too salty.In terms of ambiance, we were seated in the basement area which felt cold with bad cafeteria lighting and a lack of any good background noise / music. The service was mediocre & factory line, with missed drink orders, no rhyme or reason to the order in which the food was brought out, and they forgot the rice altogether.All in all I would not recommend this place for dinner, but could see grabbing a quick & cheap workday lunch here.",

We knew to expect this and weren't dissapointed. The food was excellent and the selection of dishes was perfect. The beef buns were great and something we would definitely order again. Having Peter select menu options for us in smaller portions than they were available from the menu allowed us to sample more dishes and at a reasonable price. Dinner for two with drinks came to under $60.",

Not sure if true as there was a party of eight already seated downstairs. All in all tasty, reasonable definitely a repeat.

When two of us ordered the same thing, the waiter suggested (or rather insisted) that we each order something different, so we could share. When we didn't want to do that, he seemed very irritated with us. Do you have to share your food there? We ordered the rice soup, which was bland and tasteless. The sesame chicken was so over-cooked that it was hard to chew. We ordered a second round of cocktails, which took forever to get, and they came back looking much different than the first round...not sure what that was about.",

The food as prepared by the executive chef - who has classical French training - is fresh and tantalizingly delicious - especially the shrimp pockets. In keeping with the traditions established at its elder sister restaurant, House of Nan King, it's best to have Peter just bring you food - he always knows how much to bring to the table.  Oh and they know how to cater to Vegans.Also threw a 400+ person party here earlier in the year - spectacular success - the executive chef worked with us on the menu selections creating the perfect finger food dishes and the bar and wait staff worked really really hard for us - great evening - took over two floors!",

          "Review": "Decided to check it out due to reputation of sister restaurant (House of Nanking). We had different foodservers which not only made it confusing but our order was messed up a few times and service was spotty (they brought out wrong drinks, added in an extra entree which we didn't order, and progression of food was disorganized). We tried 3 different appetizers (vegetable eggrolls were VERY greasy, potstickers were average, and beef buns tasty and only notable item throughout our entire meal), sizzling rice soup (overly spicy due chili oil floating on top, and hardly any sizzling rice), and Mongolian Beef (average). With so many good Chinese restaurants in San Francisco, you can probably skip this one until they make improvements.",

Food was both too salty and too sweet--unlike any Chinese food we're accustomed to eating, but then we didn't see any Asian customers.OK for those who don't care about authenticity, but, those sensitive to salt should alert staff. Food was also unnecessarily oily.All that said, dishes were tasty and colorful, often with a caramelized element. Bok choy salad would have been really good if not for sweetness.At least it offers brown rice! And great, warm, complimentary almond cookies!",
