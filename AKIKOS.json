Most of the time when an amazing place expands the restaurant loses some of what makes it special. Well - that myth was busted. The staff was friendly, the service impeccable, and the Omikase experience was one of the top 10 meals of my life. My husband, son and I had a most memorable meal.",

However, some bites were quite over-seasoned to the point that the fish flavors were clobbered. The scallop is one example; it was over-salted to the point that it burned my tongue (but the toasted goma was memorable). The botan ebi tasted only of coconut, but the texture was perfect. Barracuda was salt and char-forward. The alcohol prices are, um, \u201caggressive.\u201dFor example, a pour of Nikka from the Barrel is $35. An entire *bottle* costs less than $70 retail in the Bay Area, and a typical price for a pour is $18, if memory serves.",

We love abalone and uni so it was awesome that they were in the menu. The only negative feedback for this review is that on the bill, there was a 5% \u201cHealth mandate.\u201d When asked the host what this extra charge, they explained that this mandate was passed to the consumer to help out the employees with health insurance. As a dinner, I am not sure why this is passed to the diners versus the owner should be paying for. Each person costs $250 to dine, not including tax, tips, and \u201chealth mandate\u201d fee so you can imagine what it will cost for the entire bill. I love the food experience but paying the extra 5% health mandate would shy me from returning.",

The food is reason enough to go to Akiko's but we were also blown away by the warm, welcoming service from literally every staff member!

I had such a memorable lunch at Akiko\u2019s, and was blown away by the thoughtfully curated Omakase course as well as the artful presentation and gorgeous yet comforting d\u00e9cor. The four \u201ctsumami\u201d dishes were all fantastic with highlights being the Chawanmushi, the warm and savory, umami-packed \u201cAn\u201d gravy with crab and shaved black truffles, and the ever so sexy Shokupan (milk bread) with Toro \u201cbutter\u201d and Kaluga caviar with gold flakes \u2013 a conversation stopper! The well-paired Sake made the experience amplified. But the highlight of the meal was their Nigiri course \u2013 the hyper-seasonal fish (\u201cTenjo\u201d Winter Buri!!) that were perfectly dry-aged to the peak of its flavor while retaining excellent texture. Every morsel was a superbly balanced, seasoned to bring out the best of each fish, from caramel-colored \u201ctare\u201d on Blue Fin Tuna to simply delicious salt with citrus zest on Hokkaido scallop. Shari was perfectly warm to the touch, and individual grains defined yet cohesive. I think Akiko\u2019s is the best value in town for the overall quality level.

The quality of the fish was fantastic and I had some flashbacks to being in japan eating sushi.

Grab an opportunity to enjoy this experience Restaurant Review: AkikosI recently had the pleasure of dining at Akikos, and I must say, it was an exquisite culinary experience. From the moment I stepped into the restaurant, I was greeted with an ambiance that beautifully blended modern elegance with a hint of traditional Japanese charm. The attentive staff made me feel welcome and ensured that my dining experience would be nothing short of exceptional.Akikos is known for its sushi, and rightly so. Ray, the talented artist behind the sushi counter, showcased his skills with every delicate creation. Each piece of sushi was a work of art, meticulously crafted with precision and attention to detail. The freshness of the ingredients was evident with every bite, and the flavors were nothing short of remarkable. Whether it was the buttery texture of the toro or the subtle sweetness of the uni, each bite transported me to a realm of culinary bliss.The fusion of traditional and contemporary flavors was a delight to the palate, creating a harmonious symphony of taste.Apart from the exceptional food, the service at Akikos was impeccable. The staff members were knowledgeable, friendly, and went above and beyond to ensure that my dining experience was memorable. They attentively explained each dish, provided insightful recommendations, and ensured that I had everything I needed throughout the meal.The overall ambiance of Akikos was elegant and inviting. The minimalist decor and warm lighting created a serene atmosphere that allowed me to fully immerse myself in the culinary journey.I highly recommend Akikos to anyone looking to indulge in a culinary experience that is truly exceptional. With Ray\u2019s artistic mastery of sushi, coupled with the exquisite flavors and impeccable service, Akikos presents an opportunity to savor the beauty of Japanese cuisine!",

There are many better tasting and better value Japanese omakase restaurants out there.Some dishes were also subpar, like a fried shrimp head that clearly had been fried much earlier in the evening so it was cold and the texture was off. For the price, you would think they would go to the trouble of frying the shrimp fresh for your round of service.Service was technical but lacking in warmth.",

It could be my misunderstanding of the restaurant intentions, but I would have enjoyed it more if there were more interactions between the chef and the customers. Other omakase experiences I've been to (cheaper even) had more interactions. Maybe it's because this place is more expensive, so the chefs interact less and focus more on the craftsmanship and taste?",

Basically ignored by the sushi chefs for a good 10 minutes and almost throughout the meal. This is So different from the highly personal service at the old location. What happened?Add to that, the meal was lackluster. Our last experience at the old location was one of the best sushi meals I\u2019ve ever had. This just felt like going through the motions.One stand out example was the dramatic difference in the signature toro caviar toast. The version last night just felt pre made and stale. A huge difference to the stellar and outstanding version at the old location.For a $1,000 total check for two people I was disappointed in every way.",

Calm cool atmosphere, in which you can see each chef preparing different fish dishes...each in a measured and careful way. In front of us the chef was taking mackerel from a traditional basket, and laying them out and covering them with salt...fascinating to watch. Then he became the nigiri chef...relaxed perfection!The food was flat out superb, with variety, imagination, and expertise, from a small egg shaped cup with dashi and a tiny poached quail egg, to tiny fried sweet fish, to snow crab in the most delicate custard with shaved winter truffles, to grilled milk toast with ground toro and a big band of caviar on top.And the nigiri! So fresh, perfect and gorgeous, with tiny amounts of bright pickled things on top! I had one glass of sake, which paired with every dish.Expensive, but worth every penny...you will never regret trying this experience!",

It's omakase only and it's not cheap ($250pp). This was a very special date - I was taking a special lady from Denver out for dinner. And the first date in SF with her or anyone in 27 years (I'm a widower). The experience delivered across the board. Very serene. Lots of polished wood making a 4 sided counter area with the sushi making mostly happening inside the quad. We were not rushed at all. I'd describe the food but I would fail. It's a mix of starters chefs creations followed by more familiar nigiri. Although I'd hesitate to say familiar.  The fish is very unique. Aged to perfection and pristine. I will go again but this is not an everyday experience. A Glass of champagne, a cocktail, some sake and the food + tip was $800+. Worth every penny. And for the bonus, my date absolutely loved the experience and is now my lady friend.",

Interesting choice of using brown rice as the base for the pieces. The texture of the rice made it very noticeable and did not pair well with any of the fish. The tuna piece\u2019s shokupan was powdery and also did not pair with the tuna. The toro piece was the worst toro I\u2019ve ever had. Sticky and somewhat fishy. A sukiyaki place I used to frequent in nyc had better and fresher toro than this omakase place. If this is someone\u2019s first omakase experience just know that this is way below par.",

After having trouble finding the restaurant (there\u2019s no sign on the street), we stepped into a quiet and upscale dining experience that was as equally beautiful as it was delicious. We were blown away by the omakase tasting menu and even got chills several times while enjoying the amazing dishes. The drinks added up quickly so I would recommend skipping to keep costs down.",

Enjoyed their omakase offering on both occasions.  Each piece is unique and the fish quality is best-of-the-best.  Seven prepared dishes, followed by 10 or 11 nigiri. The toro speaks for itself, but the cherry blossom snapper and cherry smoked trout were also among many of the highlights.  The uni was top notch, got to try both long and short spined, incredible to compare the different profiles.  Allen was our server and he did a great job walking us through each dish, suggesting an amazing new sake to try.  They only offer the omakase right now, but have a few a la carte options to try at the end if you want to go back to anything from the omakase nigiri list or sample something new.  I love the atmosphere of this place.  Small, quiet, and comfortable.  We will be back again hopefully much sooner!",

The appetizers had too much seasoning and it was hard to taste the original flavors of the ingredient. The sushi rice was very sticky and destroyed the whole nigiri experience. They definitely need to work on the rice if they really want to be a top-tier Japanese restaurant in the area.",

Akiko's omakase starts with a number of appetizers that were each well thought out and executed wonderfully, with an essence of Kaiseki. The nigiri comes after, each fish prepared to highlight and enhance the flavor. Even the 'gari' (pickled ginger) was house made and wonderfully unique, since ever other sushi restaurant in the world serves it the same way. This really captured the essence and philosophy of omakase, which literally means 'To leave into one's hands' in Japanese but is more deeply about entrusting the chef to create a wonderful meal. It's truly about showing respect to the chef and likewise the chef honoring the diner with the best dining experience. This was a true omakase experience.",

I\u2019m a fussy sushi fan so many things (too fishy) are out for me. Every single presentation was beyond superb and delicious and  plated on varied artistic china and stoneware. This is a very special restaurant with an unbelievable chef and most accommodating staff that make your feel welcome and like royalty. One hundred percent worth the value! Bravo!",

We spent about $500 for the experience. Our waiter was very inquisitive about  our expectations - at first this was not appreciated but it really worked out. He ordered for us  and the food was spectacular. Easily  my best sushi/Japanese experience in SF. Unfortunately we went for a return recently for my wife's  birthday and other than the same $500 expense the experience was meh. There were some hits  - the mature yellowtail and dungenous crab whip with shaved white truffles. But there some real duds (baby eels with ponzu - yuck) and the rest mostly meh.The real downer  was the ambiance. We sat in the back  and could smell the bathroom cleaners/oDorizers. Yuck. And our waitress was nothing like the guy we had previously - curt and not at all helpful. We will  likely try one more time but with a keep it simple(r).",

However, we were very disappointed when we saw the receipt because one of the dishes was charged $1 more per piece of nigiri. We had four of this piece. Akiko is my favorite restaurant of all time in SF. Whenever I'm in town, I've been religiously visiting Akiko alone or with friends. All of my friends have become huge Akiko's fans. I can't believe this type of error was going on and I was the only one to catch it. I have a pretty good memory and if I hadn't closely read the receipt, we would have been charged extra. This isn't about the expensiveness of the dish but about the principle of trust and paying attention to detail, which is fundamental to why I chose to eat at Akiko's. Unfortunately, neither one was there tonight and I am disappointed and feel defeated.",

By the time we found the correct place, we were 30 minutes late!  The host was understanding and was able to accommodate us less than 10 minutes after our arrival. Well worth all the walking around in SF!  The sushi, esp the nigiri was excellent. High quality sushi. Excellent service. It is pricey, so you may want to consider for special occasion or date. However, if you are looking for high quality sushi, this is the place!  We will be back!",

After waiting 15 minutes past our reservation time, without being offered anything, we were seated at the front of the restaurant.  Due to the continuous opening and closing of the door, it was freezing cold.  It would be OK if the rest of the restaurant was like that but the back main seating area was wonderful.  So there were completely separate feelings depending on where you sat.  Also, for the price of the food, our server was not as knowledgeable about the sushi and I don't feel like we received the level of service deserved.  Because of the large number of sushi restaurants in the area, I likely would not go back to this one.",

The 18 courses is very rushed, they bring 3 different plates at any given time and the flavors of each course given aren\u2019t complimentary. You get the sense that they are just trying to get you to finish the omakase as fast as possible. I enjoy wasabi on nigiri but the chef was very heavy handed on all the nigiris, their were times where I was watching my wife struggle with her burning nose because of the amount of wasabi.

Our waitress look like she was so mad for the 2 hours that we were there for. Thankfully, the servers were very nice and attentive.

However, our experience this time around was simply disappointing. Price has gone up, which we generally don't mind if the quality stays on par; that is unfortunately not the case. For the Omakase experience, there's no need to rush through the courses and served all the small bites at almost the same time. Given the pricing, one would expect a calmer experience that is a bit more slow-paced so one could take his/her time to enjoy each course. Hokkaido uni is no longer included as part of the Omakase (despite price increase), Russian uni was not available, and Wagyu beef was not included. What you get is a rush of 5-6 small bites and 8 pieces of nigiri that, based on my own perspective, were better than your average nigiri elsewhere but weren't anything unique. Outside of the subpar food experience, the host clearly did not read any of the notes we included for the reservation and brought us to a small table when there was another bigger table available. We asked our waiter if that was reserved for a bigger party and he kindly checked and moved us over.  The service by our waiter was great, but unfortunately it was not enough to save the day. Given this experience, we will likely not return and will look to explore elsewhere. Thanks.",

The service was a bit too slow for a Wednesday night. Our server wasn't very attentive to what we needed and interrupted our conversations when we didn't ask for him.  He kept coming back only to touch our chopsticks to rearrange it.  Now that I think about it, it may not have been very sanitary for him to do that. Took away our soy sauce/ginger plates because we didn't \"need\" them for the round of fishes we ordered. He didn't even ask if we would be ordering more after that.  Overall, I'd say his service downgraded our experience at this restaurant and we will probably not be coming back.",

Sushi and sashimi are very good quality for the fish a bit less for the rice, but i am picky and it is nicely executed. Sake menu is great and sommelier knowledgeable.The service is a bit cold and quiet slow. I would recommend if you want to spend a lot of cash. There are fine one star Michelin restaurants in the neighborhood with better quality/enjoyment/cost. I had 12 sushi, 3 sashimi, 2 glass of nice sake and a bottle of sparkling water for $200 without tip... probably the most expensive sushi place I ever visited... I think the chain SUGARFISH does better in term of taste and I pay $60 for omekaze and a few dollars for sake, a real bargain.",

Akiko's uses a special seasoned rice and brings the gastropub feel to traditional sushi-making. Don't let that mislead you, their sushi is delicious. The fish is fresh and the chefs know their stuff. If you sit at the counter, you will be enticed by the chefs' blade work. Came for lunch, but I would love to try their dinner",

So we are late and this person\u2019s approach and whole demeanor was completely negative...we were fine cause we just walked over from having seen a comedy show at the Masonic. Policy is fine, and as mentioned above, we were late. But I had called you back specifically that afternoon and confirmed our reservation. Your food is great and I have no problem paying $400+ for two people...you do sushi extremely well. Just lose the attitude at the door. You should be happy people are showing up at your place and not another\u2019s. Your food is too good to ruin it on something that takes no talent to produce...attitude, gratefulness.

The chef's choice nigiri were not bad, although I would appreciate more creativity in the choice of fish for the price. The tuna roll left a lot to be desired due to dull taste and rather unpleasant texture. The black cod was grilled to perfection and seasoned extremely well.With the hits and misses it's hard to recommend Akiko's, especially given the premium prices and less-than-desired creativity with nigiri.",

We ended up arriving 20 mins late -- which we totally own and apologized for. The hostess made a big fuss at the door about how we were almost 30 mins late and she didn't know if she could accommodate us, asking us -- \"are you having omakase or not?\"  It was all very off-putting, rude, and bizarre. I looked at my fiancee and asked if they're asking us to leave.  There were plenty of open tables. We eventually got seated but it was such an off-putting experience that I almost wanted to walk out. Being late was certainly our fault but being yelled at for it and being made to feel unwelcome and a burden was a terrible customer experience for someone you are asking to pay you.  Overall, food was good. We ordered sushi, it arrived quickly, we ate it and were out in 45 mins flat.",

Would not pour sake from bottles that we had ordered. The food was very lacking in terms of enthusiasm and ingenuity. For the amount they charge for importing fish from Japan, it tasted gummy and some of the pairings of sauces on the nigiri were totally off from what was expected from the fish. Its sad that the best thing here was a sushi roll. In addition to all this, the restaurant temperature was boiling hot -- I'm sure that's affecting the fish somehow. The lack of attention to the important details -- ie preparation of food -- and the emphasis on the unimportant ones -- literally moving plates mid bite several times throughout the meal -- makes this place an absolute joke.",

Jessica was also very helpful with our selection of Sake, which I don't really know how to pick when you have so many great options. She nailed exactly what we liked. They do have tables in a side room, but it's very narrow and feels a bit claustrophobic to me, I much prefer the bar seating with a view of the street.

Lack-luster flavor profile throughout the entire meal.Don't get me wrong, it's not the worst sushi I've ever had. However, I was much more satisfied with the french dip I got as follow-up when we decided to cut out early after underwhelming appetizers, nigiri moriawase, and self-selected sushi choices. Seems strange to say, but this place made me miss the sushi I could get at Bob Wasabi in Kansas City.",

The hostess' \"greeting/warning\" was total baloney and not the way to treat customers.  The food was the worst sushi I have ever eaten and way overpriced.

The main dining area appears to have been an alley between two buildings at one time or another. It's dim, tunnel-like, and extremely noisy when busy. It doesn't help that the restaurant also plays moderately loud music over the sound system. There are a few seats at the sushi bar and a three tables near the entrance that have windows to the street. These tables are in high demand.

Mistakes happen but they are apparently not interested in correcting them. I was also a little put off by the fact that I went with a friend on my birthday AND hers (we have the same birthday) and the restaurant did ZERO to acknowledge the birthdays...no dessert, no candle, not even a Happy Birthday greeting, even though I put a note on my reservation saying it was our birthdays.My advice - for a special occasion, pick a restaurant that cares.

I got the nigiri sampler plus a couple of other items and everything was so fresh and full of flavor.When I first wrote this review I gave only 4 stars for value. I came back and changed that to 5 stars as I realized that while the food was pricey it was so worth it.I will definitely visit again.",

AKIKO was a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT:1- Our server, Linh (a seemingly moody girl with no grace or enough manners) was the beginning of a mediocre experience.  2- Our Otoro was ridiculously tiny, which we would never have minded if the quality had been high.  The quality was poor.  I remember once eating at a dreadful sushi boat place & the Otoro there was better! 3-The rest of the dishes were OK or just good.  4- The pacing of the dishes was disorganized and choppy. One good thing.....Our Gindara (miso marinated black cod) was excellent but not \"wow\" enough to redeem the rest of the mediocrity.",

We made a reservation for 3 people, however the openTable system showed us only 2. So, I added a note in the system plus called the restaurant (only mailbox available) to add one more person. We arrived dressed up on time, but the waiter told us, there is only space for two and sent us back home! No flexibility or willingness to offer any alternative (eg. one place at the bar, later time etc.). No prior notice from the restaurant on our note in the openTable system (which has my email address!), no call back on my phone call. Waiter told us it is all our fault!! Left on the street we had a hard time to find an appropriate alternative restaurant without a reservation. Thank you very much for a great night in San Fransisco! Food must be fantastic and the restaurant always fully booked, since they have no interest in good service or good reviews of guests as it seems.",

The fish is extremely fresh and the service and ambiance casual.  It is not cheap, but you get an excellent quality of fish and it is served in a very uncomplicated way.  Some of the other places I have been get a little too caught up in the presentation aspect of an omakase menu.    Plus, the fact the place is small means the service is very attentive.

Timing was great and we had ~ 13 pieces which was actually perfect in term so volume -  you will NOT be hubgry but just the right amount of satiated! $100.- a head while not cheap was well worth it for the quality of sushi nigiri!",

Price is very high for sure, but absolutely worth it. If you want to have some real sashimi, this is the place! The restaurant however is quite small, and lack of lighting, which I don't really like. And the ventilating system is bad, you can smell fish and vinegar when you sit at the table, which located in the back of the restaurant.

It is located downtown San Francisco on a very busy street there is no parking on the street the nearest or closest parking area is a lot that you will have to pay at least $20 to park for an hour parking.   It is sushi only when I attempted to order something from the kitchen the server said we are out of it the second selection she said we're out of that as well so it was very limited in my food selection.  The service was excellent however the food was less desirable for my palate.   It had no flavor it was mediocre fresh and what you pay for is tiny plates I was so disappointed I had to go to another restaurant after eating there to be full.   It is extremely expensive for what you get so take a lot of money or your credit card",

Food was good and all, but in comparison to other places I've tried, I would definitely pick others over Akiko's. There wasn't a huge array of flavors as I'd hoped for. A lot of bites were heavy on the wasabi, one was even so heavy that I teared up while eating it and couldn't taste the fish at all. Service was okay. We ordered drinks and had to remind the waiter at the second course that we ordered some. And courses definitely felt rushed. We were in and out of that place within an hour. We would get served the next course before we even touched the one in front of us. One plate was even served when my boyfriend was using the restroom so the waiter awkwardly waited to the side until he returned to explain what was being served. At that, the explanations were mumbled, some were even half explained as in he threw the plate on the table, gave us the Japanese name as he was already pulling away, without telling us what it is in English. Don't get me wrong, the guy was nice and well mannered, but if I'm going to spend $300 on a few pieces of basic sushi then I'd hope service would be on their P's and Q's and I'd feel free to have a nice, relaxed meal instead of pressured to finish quickly.",

So, my review is limited  to it.  But at least I can say sushi was not good.  Sushi rice was dry and didn't go well with fish/shellfish on it.  Hotate (scallop) was the only thing I liked out of 10 pieces.  Shime-saba (marinated mackerel) was probably the worst, it was just sour and still fishy.If I have a chance to go there again, I would try different things than sushi.",

Each piece was brought out individually and immediately after preparation so the sushi temperature and flavor was not compromised. I was especially impressed by their waygo beef. The sauce flavor pairings were complimentary and did not overpower the fish. The fish was very fresh.Akiko has a great ambiance for friendly conversation. The 90's background music is the perfect volume for enjoyment but not loud enough to have to raise your voice in conversation. The service is attentive but not overbearing.",

We were in and out of there in one hour. Omakase is not what you expected as it is not the off menu chef selection. Instead it can vary depending on your budget and food allergies- ranging from $80-150 per person. It is just what the chef selects from the menu so no surprise there. Waitress could not explain the menu well, nor bother to us that the sashimi tasting menu included the same fish that we had ordered from the special menu of the day...what a waste of money.  Also don't be fooled by the price for 5 pieces of sashimi because it is not 5 pieces...only two as there are many exceptions.  This is not as authentic as you would imagine for a restaurant having such high ratings.",

It was nice and unknown back then and could always get a seat at either the sushi bar or tables.  Then when the place was renovated, their clientele tripled, and now you need to make reservations.

          "Review": "To be perfectly blunt, this is probably the best sushi restaurant in San Francisco. And this is coming from someone that has dined at most of the high-end sushi restaurants in the glorious City (have yet to try Hashiri, but I really doubt it will compare favorably at this point, especially regarding the price point).Extremely rare, high quality, and unique ingredients prepared masterfully by talented culinary artists are but one of the highlights of this dining experience. Point in case, this is the only restaurant that I can recall that offers 4 DIFFERENT and unique kinds of Uni, including the extremely rare Russian Uni. Unbelievably creamy and delectably flavorful. What a treat.To make things as easy as possible, sit at at the sushi bar and opt for the omakase. You will not be disappointed. I knew I was in for a superior dining experience when the very first dish of the omakase that was served had BOTH Japanese Snow Crab and Hokkaido Uni. Absolutely divine. The Otoro with Uni was also another highlight. All of the sushi pieces now that I think about it were excellent.To receive the full experience, sushi bar seating is essential. And if available, requesting Chris is a requirement, he was absolutely a culinary sushi master, very impressive skill set. 20 pieces of nigiri/sushi later, I knew this was perhaps one of the most epic sushi experiences I have ever had. Chris undoubtedly delivered. And yes, I have been to Tokyo various times and have even eaten at Tsujiki market.Domo arigato Akiko's! We WILL be back.",

Even worse we felt very rushed.  We have done omakase many times before and were always served one dish at a time.  At Akiko's, our server brought out 2, 3, even 4 dishes at the same time.  He cautioned us to eat quickly as the nigiri was getting stale and losing its intended flavor.  It's frustrating at a restaurant of any quality or price point to feel rushed through your meal, but we felt genuinely angry when we received the bill. Extremely expensive and far from worth it.",

Finally made the other evening, and it didn't disappoint.  In fact it was quite the experience, we were impressed with everything we ate.The menu is expensive, definitely not a newbie sushi kind of place.  We thought we knew our fish until we saw the daily special menu of fish most of which we have never heard of.  So being our first time we leaned on our waiter to put together omokase selection for us based on what we typically like, and what we don't care for.  The 6 sashimi's and 4 nigiri sushi's were increadible, and afterwards said it will be hard to eat sushi anywhere else after this.  Everything was so fresh, clean tasting, we actually never ended up using the wasabi and soy sauce on the side, didn't need it.  Along with the sushi, also got the cod and fried squid, both were amazing in themselves.  Don't forget to get recommendations on sake to pair with your meal.Not cheap, yet not over the top expensive either.  Make reservations in advance to get in, it's a small restaurant.  Worth a visit if strolling around the Union Square areas.  I believe lunch offers more hot food in addition to the sushi.",

The service people is always enthusiastic and most of the time has the knowledge about the food.  Though the food is great in general, there are some consistency issues.  The consistency level seems to differ between chefs.  My normal pick is the ensui uni, which is hokkaido uni served with a small bite of rice, nigiri style, on a spoon.  The first couple times the uni would be served in whole pieces (about 3-4 per spoon), not scrambled, no cuts, just plain whole piece.  The last time I visited, the same uni was like scrambled!  Even though the taste doesn't change much, it had a different texture.  It's just not as exquisite as it should be.  Another item, which is another of my go to, especially for lunch, is the teriyaki chicken.  The first three times I've had it, it was tender, juicy, and clean.  There would be a thick-ish teriyaki sauce under it with minimal toppings (broccoli or just a piece of greens).  The last two time I had it, it changed to a less thick teriyaki sauce, and topped with asparagus and kim chi.  The chicken wasn't as tender and has the texture of which I can buy from a fast food Chinese restaurant.  Not sure what happened there.",

We arrived at 12:00 for a 12:15 and had to wait 15 minutes to be seated in a empty dining room, meantime there isn't a lounge to wait in.  Once we arrived at our table, our waiter pushed us to have the chef select our food, when we politely declined and ordered from the menu we were told that they were out of almost everything on the menu.  Note the restaurant just opened on a Thursday afternoon.  It was very strange and uncomfortable at this point. The waiter also seemed nervous and impatient to take our Ala cart order because as we were ordering he made no eye contact and looked around the room.  He was clearly annoyed he had to take an order.  It encouraged me to look around as I noticed everyone was eating the same thing! As the food arrived it was messy, some fallen over on the plate to the point the fish eggs had spilled out. As it came time for our bill it was to no surprise that it was $150 for lunch that included two mid price cold sake and very little food, where we both left hungry.  I would save you time and money and skip even trying this place.  I had been interested in going since the chronicle wrote an article on Akiko's blue shrimp dish, but of course they we're out of that as well.  Note they were not out because they sold out, they were out of items because the chef didn't order enough fish.  This restaurant is obviously struggling with food costs, ordering and scared so much of waste that it should go to a set menu option to be more honest with guest.  Overall, a very strange dining experience.",

After driving by the location a couple times and not seeing it from our car, we parked and walked to the address. Still we couldn't find it and ended up in an Irish bar. There, the hostess told me Akiko's was next door. It was. It didn't have a sign anywhere to show diners the location. Very odd but I suppose it's hip.Originally, I had asked for the sushi bar but the person taking my reservation told me that was dependent on whether it was open when we arrived. No reservations for sushi bar. Oddly, the sushi bar was half full when we arrived but they were \"saving\" those seats for more important people, I presume. Isn't that a reservation? Perhaps this too is a hip plan.The first table the hostess tried to seat us at was directly behind the front door in a teency corner. That didn't look good so we waited for a table. The food was fine. The best being the fish flown in from Japan. Astronomically expensive, but again, that made the place even more hip. All in all, I've been to sushi restaurants that were much friendlier and had wonderful food. There were just to many obstacles to want to go back to Akiko's.",

Soft shell crabs roll was good, spicy tuna was too spicy, Foto Maki was the worst I have ever tasted and California was plain.  The miso Black Cod was very fresh but tasteless.

She said that tables are reserved for parties of 2, even though I was seated before at a table w/o asking, and that they are fully booked and that she will try to find a table.Scanning around a restaurant, I could see that they had 3 open 2-tops and 2 open 4-tops along w/ 2 open bar stools.She got back to me and said that if I want a table, I have to wait, and that my seating will be limited to an hour. I told her that I was planning to have the omakase and that an hour is not enough. She said that I have to set at the bar if I am to get the omakase. Then she started lecturing me that an omakase was best with a face-to-face interaction w/ the chef.She made me feel that my reservation was less valuable than other reservations. I was about to spend $150+ and I was not about to risk back pain for that. I told the hostess that I was not about to risk getting back pain and left.",

If you go there you must instruct them to stop serving you at a pre-set price point otherwise the restaurant will surprise you with the final bill. We asked about the price before ordering and he replied it 'started at 100 dollars', and we said that we were ok with around 100 dollars. But it felt like a bait and switch when the bill came back 150 per guest (we were treating one of the diners as a going away celebration so each of us paid more than $200). This is just an ingenuine way of doing business. The final bill is simply all the ala carte charges added up.  There is no benefit in price for choosing the omakase. To know the cost ahead of time, you should order on your own, or be hyper vigilant. Unfortunately having to state this sort of defeats the purpose of going out to dine here. The food IS very good; but we left there with the proverbial bad taste in our mouths---disappointed and upset about the dishonesty more than anything else, and thus unable to recommend Akiko to others for fear of that our friends would suffer the same treatment. We also see that others have made the same complaint so assume the restaurant doesn't see any need to alter its practice.",

If, however, you appreciate traditional sushi done extremely well, and you want the chance to try different kinds of fish that you might not see on most menus in a small, intimate setting where the service is top-notch, or if you finally got up the courage to ask out that guy in accounting or the girl in the engineering department (and you know they like sushi!), this is the place.I'd suggest ordering from the nama menu, which has all of the specials that are in season and where you're most likely to find something you've never seen before.

We lived the octopus and cucumber salad, and the yellowtail shoulder was probably the best sashimi I've ever had. Our server was very good, suggesting special dishes as we moved on with our dinner, he just kept them coming. Would have returned every night of my visit to San Francisco if I could.",

The rolls were good too, but to really reap the benefit, it's great to taste the fish on its own. In terms of atmosphere, it is a really small restaurant, so the tables are pretty close to each other. However, that didn't get in the way of my experience at all. I could still easily hear and talk to my dining partner. Our waiter was also great. Overall - YES.",

I saw many people turned away because there was literally no room and they didn't have reservations. The place is small - I would think it can only seat about 40-50 people. I had a nigiri 6 piece sample and the Maki specialty roll with a Pinot Noir. The presentation was flawless and the food very good. I commented to the sushi chef that one of my pieces seemed \"fishy\" - I didn't mean it was spoiled or bad, it was just not my favorite. He replaced it with a striped sea bass that was perfect. This was a recommendation from a \"local\" of where to find good sushi. Highly recommend.",

The rolls had much rice and were falling apartThe main problem the restaurant didn't have any special something that makes you want to come back They didn't make any effort to be creative or have special sauces. It's a diner for sushi in the busy financial district (which seems like the only reason anyone would go there).

Almost went for the Omakase but decided that we wanted to pick our own fish as well as additional starters which were the Agedashi Tofu and Kampachi Kama that included half of the head. Both were excellent. There was a little bit of a wait for the Kampachi since our waiter didn't tell us until last minute that they were out of the Hamachi Kama.

The fish was exquisite and wonderfully prepared. The young chefs were fantastic-quick, skilled, with great personality. Extremely high quality fish with several luxurious, uncommon types. This is not the place to go if you want great big California rolls. However, if you want high quality sushi, expertly prepared-this is the place. They also have a nice sake menu and were very helpful in choosing sake and fish pairings. For the quality of the meal, the price wasn't bad (under $400 for two, including three small bottles of excellant sake).",

Start from the fresh daily menu and supplement with items from the regular menu if you are still hungry. They do tend to run out of certain items so have some backups in mind. The servers are very helpful in explaining the flavor of each type of fish. For example, if you prefer salmon over tuna let your server know and he/she can recommend something from the fresh menu. It can be a bit pricey for nigiri but the flavors are so worth it. I think it would be best to dine here during typical dinner hours (if you can get a table!) but definitely try to get a larger table along the benches and not the lame one by the bathroom.",

I brought a few clients from Tokyo here, and they confirmed my thoughts that the fish is the freshest I've had outside the Tokyo fish markets. They were blown away. The nigiri is amazing, and every roll is incredible. Specifically, I love their 49er Roll, which has lemons on top giving it a truly unique flavor profile.

The prices are very high for what you get, arguably too high. The fish is fresh and tastes unique with special seasonings of the rice and fish which are far from traditional. It is worth a try, but may not fit everyone's flavor profiles or budget. Cooked food is below par for the price you pay, Saba was overcooked and the Tempura batter is missing the light crispiness of tempura. I would go back, probably not on my dime.",

It is clean and has a cozy feel given that it's small and in an old building. The service is fantastic, our water was always topped off, and they were quick when we asked for anything. The food was okay, but not memorable. The noise level, on the other hand, is something you won't forget. I'm always willing to pay more for ambiance.

Fresh and flavor fish that does not require anything to mask its flavor. The only complaint I have is the rice. Nigiri is one of my favorite ways to enjoy Sushi as great rice compliments great seafood. At Akiko's they opted not to use traditional sushi rice, which affected both the texture and enjoyment of the nigiri. Though my wife and I did not enjoy the rice, the fish was excellent and a meal that we look forward to repeating.",

The focus of the chef's menu really is the fish; so if you're looking for more variation, you may not find it. But the fish is soooo good. They do some interesting things like a slight char on some of the nigiri rice, which added a nice depth. One criticism, though, is the nigiri rice didn't hold together well; maybe it was an off night. The final bite was a Wagyu beef and truffle nigiri. Yum, yum, yum! Awesome way to end the meal!",

Bluefin tuna belly was expensive but amazing. Liked that they didn't bring all the food together (like many other sushi places do) on a single plate.

I love the look of the space also and all the unique touches that add to its high end appeal. The fish served is of much different prep than what we usually have. No wasabi and soy here. And none needed either! We loved all the different garnishes and sauces as well as the different fish seared with their butane torch which left no odd fuel flavor.Highlights were their Ensuii uni and their seared A5 Miyazaki Wagyu topped with shaved French Black Winter truffles.At well over $500 for 2, we won't be going here every week but sure will return soon!

The staff and quality of seafood has remained the same (amazing) over the years, the only thing that has changed is the d\u00e9cor. We have our usual order that the servers know well, however they are great at recommending the freshest, in season fish - which we love.

It's rare for a party to be able to share a strong omakase side by side with an order of tempura and chicken teriyaki. The sub-$100 price to be fairly reasonable and a good way to sample what the restaurant is capable of offering. The $10 corkage was pretty sweet.",

When I told them we wanted Omakase menu, he corrected me by saying, there's no menu given for Omakase, but I explained I had a hearing impairment and he was annoyed with me which made me feel terrible. The sashimi was ok, one piece was very mealy and I couldn't eat it. But many of the other dishes were good to excellent.

So the service was great in general, but most importantly, the fish was SO GOOD. Fresh, flavorful, and there was a great selection of fish as well as warm dishes. My friend and I ordered a few salads and a sashimi platter and were floored at how delicious everything was.

The soy sauce is unreal.  I believe they make it themselves.  The cuts make every piece of fish taste like it melts in your mouth.  Just an incredible sushi experience.

We also had the uni (st Barbara). we normally get ours from Maine. Had the tiger shrimp (Raw) sushi, was a bit over marinated but enough for us to be satisfied. Overall I think this place is great for food tasting, I wouldn't really get full from this as I come from NYC and our sushi are much more affordable but lack the quality of this restaurant.

We were seated originally at a small table near the front and while it wasn't a bad spot, a few minutes after being seated we were moved by our waiter to the best table in the house (private corner spot that opened after our arrival) with no prompting by us. That made our dining experience all the more memorable. We've eaten a lot of sushi at places like Nobu and this beat it. It was literally the best we've ever had.",

Wagyu Beef nigiri \u2013 excellent - opt for the black truffle topping if available (delicately sliced, not over bearing). Walu & Umimasu sashimi are a must. 'Special menue' sashimi were superb \u2013 order Otoro and save it for your last bite of the meal. Rolls \u2013 the Forty-niner (thin sliced lemon perfectly balanced chunks of sweet organic salmon).

While the server took his time with us to explain various menu items, at least 3-4 of the food items and 3-4 bottles of wine were sold out. We finally got a bottle of wine ordered, but the waiter forgot about it. One of the food items I ordered was also sold out, but I only found out about this when the food was set in front of me and the waiter explained that the chef made a substitution.

The ambiance was very sensual, dimly lit with candles and the prices were very reasonable for the amazing quality of food we received.Of course if you come there really hungry, you'll have to shell out more. I had a nigiri-sashimi duo, which was very buttery smooth and miso with cucumber salad-the ginger-soy dressing was magnificent- and a delicious delicate red bean gelato for dessert,which topped the night off perfectly.

It's a little thing, but it bugged. Refills for beverages a bit slow. We were 2 min. early on our reservation and they made us along with another person wait outside. 5 min. later you could tell they were still not ready to open, but reluctantly sat us.

Perhaps the problem was ordering omakase without being at the bar, so we could not communicate with the chef, but we left spending a lot of money and feeling disappointed in the selection.",

Amazing items cured and made in house, this is my \"go to\" spot for great food, no limits.  Ask for the Omakase (Chef's choice), they will blow you away.  Ask for Ray, he will explain where each fish came from, what is special about it.  Akiko's takes pride in the fact that all the fish they serve is sustainably caught.  I love this place.",

The first sign of something amiss was the lack of the \"Nama\" speciality menu -- rare fish -- featured on their web site. So be it....we ordered...and waited....and waited. They forgot one drink order and need to be reminded. After about 30 minutes the waiter comes out to let us know they are out of tofu -- really??? --- so my appetizer needed to be reordered. Hmm....why did this take so long to notice? I asked for hamachi Kama, another staple...they were out of that. Okay, then, the mackerel.Our food arrived at 650...sans mackerel, which never came.

The fish didn't fall off the rice when dipped upside down in the soy sauce! The place setting came with a chopstick rest, which I liked. Don't see that too often. Our only quibble is that with such good sushi, we expected tamago (egg) to be available. It wasn't that night and we were there early. Also, traditional sushi places offer a hot towel at the start of the mean, to clean your hands. That would have been nice. Service was knowledgable and attentive. Will go back to try the less expensive udon/sashimi or udon/shioyaki combination. Our meal for two was $100 for 6 piece omakase plus beer, calif roll and spinach dish.",

With such a vast menu it's the best way to try new fish. You could certainly go for standard rolls, which they have and are probably better than standard, but the fish is so fresh and such high quality that a roll does it. disservice. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and provided perfect pairings of sake. Overall it was the best sushi experience we've had in the City, surpassing previous best Ozumo with better food quality and more intimate atmosphere. Will definitely go back for special occasion omakase dinners, or to try select fish at the bar.",

My server was inattentive. I practically had to stand up on my table to get him to come back to the table. Most of the time I ended up flagging down some other server to get what I needed. The menu is poorly designed, hard to read, and difficult to understand if you can read it. It assumes the customer has every meal in a Japanese restaurant. Having said that, the sushi was excellent, as was the poached spinach. But I can't recommend the place, and I would never go back. There are too many excellent choices in San Francisco.",

Each piece of fish tasted fresh, not slimy and had distinguishable characteristics and flavors. The main problem was the pacing of the food. The first tuna sashimi salad came out and then we waited for about 45 minutes before any food was even pointed in our direction. Luckily Akiko graciously offered us free shots of sake to apologize for the wait. I really enjoyed the nigiri here and the fish selection. I will definitely be back here in the future.",

We asked him just to feed us (\"omakase,\" for those familiar with Japanese), and he brought out a veritable feast of sushi and sashimi. The selections he brought us were fantastic, fresh, and original. And the black sesame ice cream was the perfect end to a truly satisfying meal.The short of it is to make reservations, ignore any rudeness, and just let them feed you here.",

We watched this play out 7 more times with other patrons - refusal without reservations and then smartphone use for reservations. The other challenge was their wine/drink list.

They have an amazing variety of fish, so don't order the boring generic \"salmon\" and \"tuna\" and \"yellow tail\". Try instead the special varieties of these and other fish that you can't find in 99% of other sushi joints. Try Arctic Char, Umimasu (ocean trout), Kurodai, and the fish that they have on the specials menu that changes weekly.  You'd be glad you did.",

Although I understand that restaurants need to maintain their flow of customers and try to keep reservations, I do not understand asking your customers to leave so that you can seat another big party when there are plenty of other seats towards the front. Not only were we asked to leave, but the manager was not apologetic about it and told us it was our fault for being late in the first place which pushed everything else back. My friends and I were planning on buying more alcohol and food too. Good restaurant, but service could be better.",
